title: About this Blog
---

Welcome to my blog! After a lot of dithering I finally figured out how to use github pages for blogging, not only is it free but also allows me to
write blogs containg math equations. The latter feature is especially useful since I do plan to blog a lot about topics in Science and Technology.
I have a wide range of interests, so expect to see blogs on topics such as:

- Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: This is a very exciting area undergoing major changes as we speak. I have been teaching courses on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning at Santa Clara for the past few years, and preparing for these lectures keeps me abreast of the latest developments. New discoveries are being made almost on a daily basis and I will blog about research papers that I read and am excited about.
- History, Politics, Economics: I love reading history, and a particular area of recent interest is the history of Ancient India. In the past I have read a lot about Ancient Greece and Rome as well as years around the time of the Renaissance in Europe. Combining this with my interest in Science, I am also deeply interested in the history and philosophy of Science and the Scientific Method, so expect to see blogs on these topics.
- Physics and Mathematics: Physics was my first love back in my school and college days and I love to read about Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, not only at the technical level but also the history of how they were developed. I am still trying to fully understand Quantum Field Theory, so expect to see blogs on these topics. Einstein is one of my heroes (along with Gandhi) and I place the Feynman Lectures on Physics up there on the pantheon of books along with the Bhagwad Geeta or the Bible.
- Travel: I love travelling and plan to blog about places I have visited.
- Topics in Biology: I learnt about Molecular Biology relatively late in life, since this topic was not taught when I was in school. But I have read quite a bit in this area as well in recent years and plan to blog about it. I have a particular interest in the Origin of Life and the early evolution of plants and animals.

So in general, I love to learn about new things and am constantly reading and trying to understand them. I hope to use this blog as a record of my thoughts and musings as I do so.
