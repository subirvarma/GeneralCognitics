# Artificial Neural Networks and the Scientific Method

Something wonderful happened to the human race in the 1600s. After being essentially flat for almost 2000 years (since the peak of the Roman Empire), the economic rate of growth sudenly took off in an exponential fashion, leading to the current world that we live in. The question is: What Happened? A leading candidate for the answer is, the Scientific Revolution. But science has been practiced since the time of the Greeks. What was so different about the way science was done post 1600 compared to the past?

This question was posed by Michael Strevens in his book "The Knowledge Machine". In this post I will begin with a summary of his findings, and then try to connect this with the rise of Artificial Neural Networks or ANNs. After a long period of gestation, ANNs have suddenly started making progress in leaps and bounds and a big open question is whether they represent a fundamentally different way of doing science. And if so, what will it lead to? Is this a new exponential boost to our civilization? 

This question was posed by Noah Smith in [this blog post](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic), in which referred to the Scientific Revolution as the Second Magic, and to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the Third Magic (with Writing being the First Magic). In his opinion AI is a fundamentally new way of doing science compared to the original Scientific Revolution. I will critique this hypothesis, and propose that indeed there is a difference in the way is AI is done and what came before it, but at the root it is a continuation of the original Scientific Revolution, but using a vastly superior new tool.

# Why Did Science Take Off After Newton?

So, what happened in the 1600s? The answer in one word is: Newton. Before Newton, scientists (or Natural Philosphers as they were then called), tried to find explanations for natural phenomena, but these explanations involved factors such as theological, aesthetic or philosophical considerations. According to Strevens, post Newton all these extraneous factors where thrown out, and the only thing that mattered was the agreement between predictions from the theory and empirical measurements. This idea was actually proposed by Sir Francis Bacon in the early 1600s, but was first rigorously put into practice by Newton.

As an example of a theory from before Newton, consider Rene Descartes theory of planetary motion. Aristotle back in the 3rd century B.C. tried to explain all motion, as an innate desire for objects to seek out their natural state, so in a sense he was ascribing a biological function to in-animate objects. Descartes, who lived just before Newton, started from the principle that nothing moves unless it is pushed, which is actually quite reasonable, and concluded that empty space between the planets is not really empty but is filled with particles that are pushing the planets along. Note that both these theories were based on philosophical beliefs of their originators and were scientific dead-ends, since they could not be used to make reliable predictions.

When Newton proposed that the planets move becuause of the force of Gravity, that varied as the inverse square of the distance, then he was aided by several advances in the astronmy that had taken place in the preceding century. Tycho Brahe had made very precise measurements of the motion of the planet, which was quite a feat since he did it in the pre-telescope era. These measurements where then used by Johannes Kepler to propose his Three Laws of Planetary Motion, which were very precise mathematical relations governing various aspects of a planet's motion such as the shape of its orbit and relationship between its distance from the Sun and its period of revolution. Newton realized that the Inverse Square Law can be used to derive Keplers's Laws, and also provides an explanation for all motion, not just in the heavens but also here on Earth. But there was one problem with this theory: The newly postulated force of gravity seemed to be propagating through empty space from the Sun to the planeets, which seemed to be hard to believe since, unlike Descartes's theory, there was no agent that was pushing planets along through direct contact. Newton dismissed this criticism, and his reponse, that is recorded in the second edition of the *Principia* from 1713 was, *"I do not feign hypothesis"*. 

Newton was using the newly proposed Baconian Principle which stated that the only true test of a scientific theory is that its predictions should agree with experiment, other considerations don't matter. He clearly did not have an explanation for Gravity propating through empty space, but he was saying that this did not matter. Furthermore he couched his throry in a few mathematical equations from which very precise predictions could be obtained. As pointed out by Strevens, this was the critical link that led to the Scientific Age. Henceforth, all Scientific Theories had to follow the template laid down in the *Principia*, even those from other non-mathematical sciences such as biology: **The proof whether a theory being proposed is correct is entirely based on its agreement with experiments** and nothing else. 

As Strevens points out, this was a highly irrational idea to grasp for people living in that age, who favored theological explanations for natural phenomena. A very important aspect of this way of doing science was that the scientist's explanations for how he arrived at his theory did not matter. It could very well be that one could arrive at the right theory by using the wrong reasoning for it, as long there was experimental agreement, all was forgiven. 
Examples of this abounded in the centuries after Newton, for example Maxwell used Faraday's ides of elastic lines of force in a space filled with a substance called ether to arrive his theory of electro-magnetism. Later Einstein showed that neither assumption was necessary for the theory to hold.

A very good example of more modern theory that sounds completely irrational, but nevertheless has excellent agreement with experiments, is Quantum Mechanics. Even after a 100 years, scientists still don't understand light could both be a partcle as well as a wave depending on the experiment. Not only that the particle-wave dulaity extents to pievces of matter such as the elementary particles that make up the atom! There is no understanble physical picture that explains this phenomena just as 400 years ago there was no good explanation for Newton's idea of Gravity propagating through empty space. But the equations of Quantum Mechanics are the most precise descriptions that we have of the reality that we live in, even though we don't understand why they work.

The success of physics in explaining natural phenomena post Newton has had an un-intended consequence. Since all Physics theories can be codified in a few 'simple' equations that can be used to explain a huge amount of natural phenomena, we expect this to hold in other areas of knowledge as well. Hence scientists of the more theoretical bent are always searching for a some simple underlying principle that can be used to explain complex phenomena. But this program has run into problems in recent decades, where there doesn't seem to be simple theories in fields such as economics that can explain a wide range of phenomena. The same is true for Biology in general, and especially for the emerging field of neuroscience. Hence it could be that Physics is more of an exception than the rule in being able to work with simple all encompassing theories that can be specified using just a few equations. 

# Are Artificial Neural Networks Science?

I am going to argue that the functioning of ANNs hew pretty closely to the original Baconian definition of what constitutes Science, but with an important exception: The equations in ANNs are no longer simple and elegant equations that we see in Physics, but are highly complex with hundreds of millions of parameters. But just as in Baconian Science, an ANN model lives or dies by how well its results agree with 'experiment'. 

Why are Physics equations simple and ANN equations complex?
