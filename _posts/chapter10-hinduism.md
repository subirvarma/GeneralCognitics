# Greater Magadha and the Origins of Hinduism

While I was doing the research for my post on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), I acame across the works of the Finnish Indologist Ask Parpola, and further digging led me to the Dutch Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst. I ordered copies of their books, *The Roots of Hinduism* and *Greater Magadha*, and I am going to summarize some of their theories in this post. Bronkhorst's Greater Magadha was of particular interest, since it delved into the history of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, which is part of the country where my ancestors come from. These two works also had interesting connections with the IVC and my family history, that I have written about in previous posts.

According to Bronkhorst, two distinct cultures existed in Northern India until the period close to start of the current era. Both of these cultures were influenced by  the Indo-Europeans who had come into the sub-continent in the period 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The culture to the West was found in the kingdoms of Kuru-Pancala kingdoms and was located in the area called Doab, betwen the Ganga and the Yamnuna rivers. The culture to the East  was associated with the Kingdoms of Magadha, Videhla and Kosala and comprises the regions of present day Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar. The confluence of the two cultures took place in the period between the second century BCE and the second or third century CE and resulted in the Classical Indian Culture that we are familiar with.

The big difference between the two cultures was due to the fact the Western culture was Brahmanical based on the Rigveda, while the Greater Magadha culture rejected Vedic philosophy. It developed religious practices of its own that were very distinct from Vedic Brahamanism, and served as the birthing ground for the religions of Jainism and Buddhism. The Greater Magadha area was also responsible for the so called second-urbanization in India (after the IVC) with cities such as Patli-Putra and Rajgriha established, also and gave birth to the Mauryan Empire that carried the first great unificication of the country. 
Bronkhorst points out the following differences between the Western and Eastern cultures:

- Brahmins lived on both sides of the cultural divide, but a different social order existed in Greater Magadha in which the Kashatriyas were accorded greater status. As a result Magadhans are almost universally derided in all of Brahmanical literature. 
- The Greater Magadhans constructed burial mounds that were round, in contrast to the four-cornered versions that existed in the West. These round mounds later gave birth to the Stupas that we find in Buddhist sites in later times and this practice was shared by Jainism as well. An early Brahmanical texts called the *Satapatha Brahmana* which was probably composed in pre-Buddhist times,  talks about this distinction. They looked down at the practice of constructing round mounds and associated it with godlessness and social disorder. 
- The speech patterns (or accent) of the people to the East was different than their Western counterparts, and was also looked down upon. It is interesting that this cultural divide has continued on to the present time, with the speech accent of of people from Bihar or Eastern Uttar Pradesh being instantly recognizable (and often derided by other Northerners). 
- The pre-Buddhist (and Jain) religion of Greater Magadha featured a belief in rebirth and karmic retribution (the belief that we will pay a price in our future lives for the bad deeds from the current life). The Jain religion adopted this belief, and worked out practces by which the karmic retribution could be avoided, by way of painful ascetic practices, such as ceasing all activity, physical as well as mental, and remaining motionless for long stretches of time (sometimes starving oneself to death). Bronkhorst is of the opinion that these beliefs and practices were not confined to the Jains or Buddhists in Greater Magadha, but were more widely dispersed within the society ad formed part of the spiritual culture of Greater Magadha. The practice of Yoga as described in the Mahabhartha and the Bhagwad-Gita, which are post-Vedic scriptures, shows the influence of the Jain meditation practices on Classical Hindu culture that followed. The original Vedic religion did not incorporate a belief in rebirths or karmic retribution, and these were adopted after the cultures fused together. The Bhagwad Gita criticizes the practice of avoiding Karmic Retribution by being motionless (since man's original nature or *prakriti* is by definition motionless) and proposed other ways by which it can be acheived, such as *jnanyoga* or the 'discipline of knowledge' and the *karmayoga* or the *discipline of action*. The Gita also propounds on the concept of a self that does not participate in, and is not touched by actions, a concept that found its orgin the religions of Greater Magadha, particularly the Ajivikaya school (check on this). 

   The Buddhists on the other hand rejected the idea of extreme ascetcism of the Jainas (to avoid all acts) or the notion of an inactive self as propounded in the *Gita* (so that all acts become acceptable) in order to acheive salvation. The believed that the real problem is not one's acts, but the driving force behind these acts, which they identified as desire or intention. Hence acheiving salvation is a psychological process of eliminating all desires, not just immobilization of the body and mind or knowledge of the true nature of self.
   
   In his book Bronkhorst gives several reasons for his theory that the belief in rebirth and Karmic Retribution and the religions Jainism and Buddhism originated within the cultural milieu of Greater Magadha, rather than within the Vedic tradion (as a reaction to Hinduism). This includes analysis of the Vedic sources including the Rigveda and the Upanishads as well as the Mahabharatha, in which he shows that idea of Karmic Retribution was something that was added on to these works from an alien culture, as opposed to organically conceived. He also does a detailed analysis of the chronology of that period to show that Upanishads (which has the most mentions of the re-birth doctrine) was actually composed later than thought, and may have been in the same era as the of the Buddha, so it was probably influenced by Greater Magadhan culture. 
   
-  According to Kenneth Zysk (1991), Ayurvedic medical practices did not originate in Vedic religion. Their roots lie in Jainism and Buddhism, i.e. in Greater Magadha. The medicinal practices described in the Vedas involved  sorcery, spells and amulets, while Jain and Buddhist literature talks about using diet, ointments and poultices for healing. The latter is more in line with the rational therapy in Ayurvedic medicine. Based on observations of Indian healing practices by Magasthenes (in the 3rd century BCE), Bronkhurst concludes that these two distinct ways of doing medecine co-existed in India in the late-Vedic period, and the one way this could have happened was if they occuped distincy geograpical areas, i.e., Vedic Society and Greater Magadha respectively.
-  Which Gods did the Greater Magadhans worship (page 61)? This knowledge is lost in the mists of history, but Brankhorst makes the case that Kapila, who is associated with the Samkhya school of philolosophy, was one of the dieties worshipped in Greater Magadha.

Brankhorst's book raises an interesting question: If indeed his thesis is correct, then what was the historical reason that two distinct cultures existed in the region of the Ganges Plain in the first millenium BCE? They continued next to each other for at least five or six centuries, if not longer, before their merger happened.
