# Greater Magadha and the Origins of Hinduism

While I was doing the research for my post on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), I came across the works of the Finnish Indologist Ask Parpola, and further digging led me to the Dutch Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst. I ordered copies of their books, *The Roots of Hinduism* and *Greater Magadha*, and I am going to summarize some of their theories in this post. Bronkhorst's Greater Magadha was of particular interest, since it delved into the history of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, which is part of the country where my ancestors come from. These two works also had interesting connections with the IVC and my family history, that I have written about in previous posts.

The traditional history of Ancient India states that Buddhism arose around the 5th century BCE within a culture that was predominantly Vedic Hindu, and was a reaction to issues such as the caste system and excessive emphasis on rituals that existed within Vedic Hinduism (this has often been compared to how Protestanism separated out from Catholicism in medieval Europe). In contrast to this, Bronkhorst argues in his book that two distinct cultures existed in Northern India until the period close to start of the current era. Buddhism and Jainism arose in the cultural environment that existed in the region to the East, referred to as Greater Magadha, within the context of religious beliefs that existed in that culture, as opposed to the Vedic culture to the West.
Both of these cultures spoke Indo-European languages and were ofshoots of a mixed culture that arose as a result of the mixing of the IVC people and the Indo-Europeans who had come into the sub-continent in the period 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The culture to the West was found in the kingdoms of Kuru-Pancala and was located in the area called Doab, betwen the Ganga and the Yamnuna rivers. The culture to the East  was associated with the Kingdoms of Magadha, Videhla and Kosala and comprised the regions of present day Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar. After staying apart for several hundred years, the merger of the two cultures took place in the period between the second century BCE (at the end of the Mauryan period) and the second or third century CE and resulted in the Classical Hindu Culture that has come down to modern times. This leads to the question: Why did two distinct cultures exist in the first place? I will discuss this interesting question later in this post.

The Western culture was Brahmanical based on the Rigveda, while the Greater Magadha culture rejected Vedic philosophy. It developed religious practices of its own that were very distinct from Vedic Brahamanism, and served as the birthing ground for the religions of Jainism, Buddhism and Ajivikism (a now extinct religion that has similarities to Jainism). The Greater Magadha area was also responsible for the so called second-urbanization in India (after the IVC) with cities such as Patli-Putra and Rajgriha established, and also birthed the Mauryan Empire that carried out the first great unification of the country. 

# Religious Practices in Greater Magadha

According to Bronkhorst, the biggest distinction between the Western and Eastern regions was in the area of religious practices (there were other distinctions as well that are discussed in the following section). The idea of re-birth and karmic retribution, i.e., the belief that we have an inner self or soul that goes through multiple births, and the form that we assume in our future births is influenced by how well we have lived our current or past lives, was something that arose in the religious traditions of Greater Magadha. 
This belief in turn influenced the three major religions that came out of Greater Magadha, namely Jainism, Ajivikism and Buddhism. All of them came up with ideas by which Karmic Retribution and the endless cycle of rebirths could be addressed.
Bronkhorst is of the opinion that these beliefs and practices were not confined to these three religions only, but were more widely dispersed within the society and formed part of the spiritual culture of Greater Magadha. In his book Bronkhorst argues that the original Vedic religion as described in the Vedic texts did not incorporate a belief in rebirths or karmic retribution, and these were adopted into the Hindu scriptures after the two cultures fused together. 

We start with brief descriptions of the three main religions in Greater Magadha: 

The Jain religion beleived that it was possible for an ascetic to atone for the sins of past lives, and also put an end to the cycle of re-births by way of painful ascetic practices, such as ceasing all activity, physical as well as mental, and remaining motionless for long stretches of time (sometimes even starving oneself to death). Since suffering is the result of activity, by suppressing activity there will be no new deeds that can lead to karmic retribution. Hence the path to happiness was through hardship. 

Ajivikism was closely related to Jainism. There are no existing texts that have survived from this religion, and the last practioners died out about a thousand years ago. Historians have been able to recreate some of their doctrines by examining the criticism of Ajivikism in Jain and Buddhist texts, and based on this the following is know about this vanished religion: Ajivikists also beleived in rebirths and karmic retribution, but unlike Jains they did not think that cessation of all activity would lead to annhilition of former actions, so karmic retribution due to these actions cannot be avoided. On the other hand Ajivikas shared with Jains the belief that non-performance of new actions will avoid karmic effects in future lives. However it won't end the cycle of rebirths, which will continue over the course of multiple eons until it reaches its natural ending. Bronkhorst proposes that the Ajivikas believed in the concept of a 'true self' which is inactive, and not affected by the activities of the body or mind. This explains their belief that our actions cannot prevent the true self from passing through multiple rebirths. This concept was further developed in the *Bhagvad Gita*.

The Buddhists on the other hand rejected the idea of extreme ascetcism of the Jainas (to avoid all acts) in order to acheive salvation. The believed that the real problem is not one's acts, but the driving force behind these acts, which they identified as desire or intention. Hence acheiving salvation is a psychological process of eliminating all desires, not just immobilization of the body and mind or knowledge of the true nature of self. Hence for Buddhists suppressing the intention behind mental activity was more important than ceasing all mental and physical actions. In some sense the Buddha changed the nature of the debate in a new direction, and away from its Greater Magadhan roots. 

After this short description of religious practices in Greater Magadha, we now discuss how these interacted with the Brahaminical tradition in the Western region. It so happens that the form of ascetism with its emphasis on the cessation of bodily and mental actions is mentioned in early Brahmanical tests such as the *Katha Upanishad* which are thought to have been composed around 800 BCE. In Part II of his book, Bronkhorst does an extensive analysis of these texts, and comes to the conclusion idea of rebirth and karmic retribution in these early Upanishads was not native to the texts but was borrowed from external sources. 
He also does a detailed analysis of the chronology of that period to show that the early Upanishads (which have the most mentions of the re-birth doctrine) were actually composed later than thought, and may have been in the same era as the of the Buddha, so it was probably influenced by Greater Magadhan culture. This view is not universally accepted by other experts, for example see [this](https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31537) review of Bronkhorst's book by Alexander Wynne.

The most extensive discussion of the idea of rebirths and karmic retribution in later Brhamanical works happens to be in the *Mahabharatha*, and more sepcifically in the *Bhagwad Gita*. According to Bronkhorst these works had a variety of differing reactions to this idea:

- Outright rejection
- Rejection of the idea that intense meditation is the only way to avoid karmic retribution, and suggestion that there other ways to do it such as Action, Knowledge
- The idea of self that does not participate in, and is not touched by actions, and hence meditation is of no help, and in fact anything that we do does not have any effect either. This last idea seems to have been influenced by the Ajivikas. But unlike them, the *Gita* proposed that living life according ones cast obligations is the right way.
 
 
The Bhagwad Gita criticizes the practice of avoiding karmic retribution by being motionless (since man's original nature or *prakriti* is by definition motionless) and proposed other ways by which it can be acheived, such as *jnanyoga* or the 'discipline of knowledge' and the *karmayoga* or the *discipline of action*. The Gita also propounds on the concept of a self that does not participate in, and is not touched by actions, a concept that found its orgin the religions of Greater Magadha, particularly the Ajivikaya school (check on this). 

The practice of Yoga as described in the Mahabhartha and the Bhagwad-Gita, which are post-Vedic scriptures, shows the influence of the Jain meditation practices on Classical Hindu culture that followed.  
   
   In his book Bronkhorst gives several reasons for his theory that the belief in rebirth and Karmic Retribution and the religions Jainism and Buddhism originated within the cultural milieu of Greater Magadha, rather than within the Vedic tradion (as a reaction to Hinduism). This includes analysis of the Vedic sources including the Rigveda and the Upanishads as well as the Mahabharatha, in which he shows that idea of Karmic Retribution was something that was added on to these works from an alien culture, as opposed to organically conceived. 
   
 # Other Differences Between the Two Regions

Bronkhorst points out the following differences between the Western and Eastern cultures:

- Brahmins lived on both sides of the cultural divide, but a different social order existed in Greater Magadha in which the Kashatriyas were accorded greater status. As a result Magadhans are almost universally derided in all of Brahmanical literature. There were were ascetics in Greater Magadhan culture as well, they were referred to as *Sramanas*. In contrast to the Western Ascetics (or *Sadhus*), who let their hair and facial hair grow long, lived by themselves and engaged in Vedic rituals, the *Sramanas* to the East shaved their heads and facial hair, lived in groups and engaged in intense meditation and fasting in their religious practices.
- The Greater Magadhans constructed burial mounds that were round, in contrast to the four-cornered versions that existed in the West. These round mounds later gave birth to the Stupas that we find in Buddhist sites in later times and this practice was shared by Jainism as well. An early Brahmanical texts called the *Satapatha Brahmana* which was probably composed in pre-Buddhist times,  talks about this distinction. They looked down at the practice of constructing round mounds and associated it with godlessness and social disorder. 
- The speech patterns (or accent) of the people to the East was different than their Western counterparts, and was also looked down upon. It is interesting that this cultural divide has continued on to the present time, with the speech accent of of people from Bihar or Eastern Uttar Pradesh being instantly recognizable (and often derided by other Northerners). 
-  According to Kenneth Zysk (1991), Ayurvedic medical practices did not originate in Vedic religion. Their roots lie in Jainism and Buddhism, i.e. in Greater Magadha. The medicinal practices described in the Vedas involved  sorcery, spells and amulets, while Jain and Buddhist literature talks about using diet, ointments and poultices for healing. The latter is more in line with the rational therapy in Ayurvedic medicine. Based on observations of Indian healing practices by Magasthenes (in the 3rd century BCE), Bronkhurst concludes that these two distinct ways of doing medecine co-existed in India in the late-Vedic period, and the one way this could have happened was if they occuped distincy geograpical areas, i.e., Vedic Society and Greater Magadha respectively.
-  Which Gods did the Greater Magadhans worship (page 61)? This knowledge is lost in the mists of history, but Brankhorst makes the case that Kapila, who is associated with the Samkhya school of philolosophy, was one of the dieties worshipped in Greater Magadha.

Brankhorst's book raises an interesting question: If indeed his thesis is correct, then what was the historical reason that two distinct cultures existed in the region of the Ganges Plain in the first millenium BCE? They continued next to each other for at least five or six centuries, if not longer, before their merger happened.
