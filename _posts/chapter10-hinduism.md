# Greater Magadha and the Origins of Hinduism

While I was doing the research for my post on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), I came across the works of the Finnish Indologist Ask Parpola, and further digging led me to the Dutch Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst. I ordered copies of their books, *The Roots of Hinduism* and *Greater Magadha*, and I am going to summarize some of their theories in this post. Bronkhorst's Greater Magadha was of particular interest, since it delved into the history of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, which is part of the country where my ancestors come from. These two works also had interesting connections with the IVC and my family history, that I have written about in previous posts.

The traditional history of Ancient India states that Buddhism arose around the 5th century BCE within a culture that was predominantly Vedic Hindu, and was a reaction to issues such as the caste system and excessive emphasis on rituals that existed within Vedic Hinduism (this has often been compared to how Protestanism separated out from Catholicism in medieval Europe). In contrast to this, Bronkhorst argues in his book that two distinct cultures existed in Northern India until the period close to start of the current era. Buddhism and Jainism arose in the cultural environment that existed in the region to the East, referred to as Greater Magadha, within the context of religious beliefs that existed in that culture, as opposed to the Vedic culture to the West.
Both of these cultures spoke Indo-European languages and were ofshoots of a mixed culture that arose as a result of the mixing of the IVC people and the Indo-Europeans who had come into the sub-continent in the period 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The culture to the West was found in the kingdoms of Kuru-Pancala and was located in the area called Doab, betwen the Ganga and the Yamnuna rivers. The culture to the East  was associated with the Kingdoms of Magadha, Videhla and Kosala and comprised the regions of present day Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar. After staying apart for several hundred years, the merger of the two cultures took place in the period between the second century BCE (at the end of the Mauryan period) and the second or third century CE and resulted in the Classical Hindu Culture that has come down to modern times. This leads to the question: Why did two distinct cultures exist in the first place? I will discuss this interesting question later in this post.

The Western culture was Brahmanical based on the Rigveda, while the Greater Magadha culture rejected Vedic philosophy. It developed religious practices of its own that were very distinct from Vedic Brahamanism, and served as the birthing ground for the religions of Jainism, Buddhism and Ajivikism (a now extinct religion that has similarities to Jainism). The Greater Magadha area was also responsible for the so called second-urbanization in India (after the IVC) with cities such as Patli-Putra and Rajgriha established, and also birthed the Mauryan Empire that carried out the first great unification of the country. 

# Religious Practices in Greater Magadha

According to Bronkhorst, the biggest distinction between the Western and Eastern cultures was in the area of religious practices (there were other distinctions as well that are discussed in the following section). The idea of re-birth and karmic retribution, i.e., the belief that we have an inner self or soul that goes through multiple births, and the form that we assume in our future births is influenced by how well we have lived our current or past lives, was something that arose in the religious traditions of Greater Magadha. 
This belief in turn influenced the three major religions that came out of Greater Magadha, namely Jainism, Ajivikism and Buddhism. All of them came up with ideas by which karmic retribution and the endless cycle of rebirths could be addressed.
Bronkhorst is of the opinion that these beliefs and practices were not confined to these three religions only, but were more widely dispersed within the society and formed part of the spiritual culture of Greater Magadha. He argues that the original Vedic religion as described in the Rigveda and other Vedic texts did not incorporate a belief in rebirths or karmic retribution, and these were adopted into the Hindu scriptures after the two cultures fused together. 

We start with brief descriptions of the three main religions in Greater Magadha, namely Jainism, Ajivikism and Buddhism: 

The Jain religion believed that it was possible to atone for the sins of past lives, and also put an end to the cycle of re-births by way of painful ascetic practices, such as ceasing all activity, physical as well as mental, and remaining motionless for long stretches of time (sometimes even starving oneself to death). The logic behind this belief was that since suffering is the result of activity, by suppressing activity there will be no new deeds that can lead to karmic retribution. Hence the path to happiness was through hardship and suffering. 

Ajivikism was closely related to Jainism. There are no existing texts that have survived from this religion, and the last practioners died out about a thousand years ago. Historians have been able to recreate some of their doctrines by examining the criticism of Ajivikism in Jain and Buddhist texts, and based on this the following is know about this vanished religion: Ajivikists also believed in rebirths and karmic retribution, but unlike Jains they did not think that cessation of all activity would lead to annhilition of former actions, so karmic retribution due to these actions cannot be avoided. On the other hand Ajivikas shared with Jains the belief that non-performance of new actions will avoid karmic effects in future lives. However it won't end the cycle of rebirths, which will continue over the course of multiple eons until it reaches its natural ending. Bronkhorst proposes that the Ajivikas believed in the concept of a 'true self' which is inactive, and not affected by the activities of the body or mind. This explains their belief that our actions cannot prevent the true self from passing through multiple rebirths. This concept was further developed in the *Bhagvad Gita*.

The Buddhists on the other hand rejected the idea of extreme ascetcism of the Jainas (to avoid all acts) in order to acheive salvation. They believed that the real problem is not one's acts, but the driving force behind these acts, which they identified as desire or intention. Hence achieving salvation is a psychological process of eliminating all desires, not just immobilization of the body and mind or knowledge of the true nature of self. Hence, for Buddhists suppressing the intention behind mental activity was more important than ceasing all mental and physical actions. In some sense the Buddha changed the nature of the debate in a new direction, and away from its Greater Magadhan roots. 

After this short description of religious practices in Greater Magadha, we now discuss how these interacted with the Brahaminical tradition in the Western region. It so happens that the form of ascetism with its emphasis on the cessation of bodily and mental actions is mentioned in early Brahmanical tests such as the *Katha Upanishad* which are thought to have been composed around 800 BCE. In Part II of his book, Bronkhorst does an extensive analysis of these texts, and comes to the conclusion idea of rebirth and karmic retribution in these early Upanishads was not native to the texts but was borrowed from external sources. 
He also does a detailed analysis of the chronology of that period to show that the early Upanishads (which have the most mentions of the re-birth doctrine) were actually composed later than thought, and may have been in the same era as the of the Buddha, so they were probably influenced by Greater Magadhan culture. This idea has also been proposed by Asko Parpola in his book, but is not universally accepted by other experts, for example see [this](https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31537) review of Bronkhorst's book by Alexander Wynne.

Religious beliefs in the Greater Magadha area were dominated by Jainism, Buddhism and Ajivikism until the end of the Mauryan dynasty in the second century BCS. For example the Emperor Chandragupta Maurya was a Jain, while Ashoka is famous for spreading Buddhist beliefs far and wide. However, after this Empire ended, there was a merger in the religious and cultural practices of the two areas, which culminated in the creation of our current Hindu religion. It resulted from a merger of ideas from Greater Magadha into the traditional Vedic religion, as well as the spread of *Varna* based caste system into Greater Magadha. Bronkhorst proposes that the epic *Mahabharata* assumed its present form while this merger of cultures was going on, and one of the objectives of the writers of this Epic was to ease this integration. They did so clearly laying out the caste duties associated with the four *varnas*, including making sure the *Kasthriya* rulers accorded proper privileges to the *Brahmin* caste. They also incorporated ideas from the *Greater Magadhan* religions into the *Mahabharata*, and more specifically into the *Bhagwad Gita*. 

The *Gita* propounds on the following ideas with Greater Magadhan roots:

- The *Gita* teaches the concept of a *Self* that does not participate in, and is not touched by ones actions. This belief seems to have been shared with the Ajivikas but unlike the *Gita*, the Ajivikas believed that there is nothing that can be done to avoid the natural progression through a large number of afterlives.
- The *Gita* rejected the idea that just inactvity enough to bring about salvation,  since the core of ones being is the *Self* that does not act. Hence the idea of karmic retribution is based on a misunderstanding, since deeds are carried out by the body and mind, neither of which is identified with the Self, which is different from both of them. Attaining knowledge of the the true nature of the Self is an alternative way to obtain salvation. Bronkhorst suggests that the origins of this idea lie in Greater Magadha, even though its is most clearly attested in the *Gita*.
- The *Gita* suggests that liberation from the effect of ones actions are possible, since in reality no actions are ever performed (by the self) and this knowledge is sufficient to obtain liberation! This is called *jnanyoga* or the 'discipline of knowledge', which could be acquired by the practice of meditation (as opposed to physical austerities). Another way is the *karmayoga* or the *discipline of action*. 
- The *Gita* teaches that if duties are performed with the right attitude, then there is no involvement of the *Self*. In order to do so, actions must be performed in complete dis-association with the fruits of those actions (such the desire to obtain happiness or avoid suffering) and this is as good as complete inactivity. Once this state is reached and since there is no involvement of the *Self*, the body (and mind) have a nature of their own that determine their activity, which is the caste duty of a person. Hence it is implying that if the caste duties are performed with the right attitude, it does not matter what those actions actually are.
 
The *Mahabharata* has other passages that show familiarity with ideas from Jainism and Ajivikism (Buddhism is ignored for some reason), but not in a refined form and in one place refers to them as being non-Vedic in origin. There must have been some amount of internal opposition within the Western Vedic tradition to these ideas from Greater Magadha and there are some Vedic texts that reflect this. For example there are some important Vedic texts such as the *Mimamsa* that have no mention of karmic retribution at all. Bronkhorst also mentions several Vedic schools such that of the *Carvakayas* that outright rejected this idea. 
   
 # Other Differences Between the Two Regions

Bronkhorst points out the following other differences between the Western and Eastern cultures:

- Brahmins lived on both sides of the cultural divide, but a different social order existed in Greater Magadha in which the Kashatriyas were accorded greater status. As a result Magadhans are almost universally derided in all of Brahmanical literature. They in turn referred to the Brahmins as 'charlatans and fools'.
- The Greater Magadhans constructed burial mounds that were round, in contrast to the four-cornered versions that existed in the West. These round mounds gave birth to the Stupas that we find in Buddhist sites in later times and this practice was shared by Jainism as well. An early Brahmanical text called the *Satapatha Brahmana* which was probably composed in pre-Buddhist times,  talks about this distinction. They looked down at the practice of constructing round mounds and associated it with Godlessness and social disorder. 
- According to Megasthenes, the Greek Ambassador to Chandragupta's court in the 3rd century BCE, there were two types of ascetics (or *sadhus*) in India during that time, the *Brahmanas* and the *Shramanas*, with distinct practices (page 92, 107). The ascetics in Greater Magadhan culture were referred to as *Sramanas*. They shaved their heads and facial hair, lived in groups, depended on alms and engaged in intense meditation and fasting in their religious practices. In contrast the *Brahmanas* ascetics let their hair and beards grow long, wore deer skin, lived by themselves and engaged in Vedic rituals. 
- The speech patterns (or accent) of the people to the East was different than their Western counterparts. It is interesting that this cultural divide has continued on to the present time, with the speech accent of people from Bihar or Eastern Uttar Pradesh being instantly recognizable (and often derided by other Northerners). 
-  According to Kenneth Zysk (1991) Ayurvedic medical practices did not originate in Vedic religion, their roots lie in Jainism and Buddhism, i.e. in Greater Magadha. The medicinal practices described in the Vedas involved  sorcery, spells and amulets, while Jain and Buddhist literature talks about using diet, ointments and poultices for healing which is more in line with the rational therapy in Ayurvedic medicine. Based on observations of Indian healing practices by Magasthenes (in the 3rd century BCE), Bronkhurst concludes that these two distinct ways of doing medecine co-existed in India in the late-Vedic period, and the one way this could have happened was if they occuped distinct geograpical areas.
-  The practice of Yoga originated in the East as part of Jain meditation practices and it was later adopted by the Classical Hindu culture.
-  Which Gods did the Greater Magadhans worship. This knowledge is lost in the mists of history, but Brankhorst makes the case that Kapila, who is associated with the Samkhya school of philolosophy, was one of the dieties worshipped in Greater Magadha.

# Why Were There Two Cultures?

Brankhorst's book raises an interesting question: If indeed his thesis is correct, then what was the historical reason that two distinct cultures existed in the region of the Ganges plain in the first millenium BCE? They continued next to each other for at least five or six centuries, if not longer, before their merger happened.
He speculated that perhaps the initial settlers arrived in the North Indian plains in two separate waves thus giving rise to the two cultures.
This theory has received support in Asko Parpola's book *The Roots of Hinduism*. Parpola proposes the following scenario:

-  Indo Europeans arrived in the Indus Valley in two separate waves. The first wave happened in the period 1900-1700 BCE, while the second wave was in the period 1400-1200 BCE. 
-  The first wave was settled in the Indus Valley and the integration with the IVC inhabitants was well underway when the second wave arrived. During the interval between the two waves, there was a cultural shift from the ancestral Indo European religion due to the interaction with the culture of the IVC. An archaic version of the *Atharvaveda* contained the religious beliefs of the first wave, while the religion of the second wave is contained in the *Rigveda*. After the two waves merged, which happened in the period around 1000 BCE, the *Atharvaveda* was re-written to conform to the beliefs of the second wave. 
-  The *Rigveda* was also modified as a result of the merger and as result ended up with two distinct portions: The original *Rigveda* of the second wave is contained in Books 2-7, while Books 1 and 7-10 contains material that is similar to that found in the *Atharvaveda* and presumably came from the first wave people. Parpola came to this conclusion by analysing the language of the *Rigveda*. He found that the Books 1, 7-10 were composed in a form of Sanskrit that was older than the Sanskrit that was used for Books 7-10. The newer version developed in the Central Asian homeland of the Indo-European tribes in the period after the first wave inhabitants had already left the region. As he puts in [this](http://www.sutrajournal.com/asko-parpola-on-the-roots-of-hinduism-by-vikram-zutshi) interview:

   *My conclusion is that the Vedic literature and religion results from the fusion of two major waves of Indo-Aryan speakers coming from Central Asia to South Asia. The old core of the Rigveda, the hymns of the "family books" II-VII, represent the tradition of the later wave, which arrived around 1400-1200 BCE, and brought with them the cult of God Indra, worshipped with Soma sacrifice. The tradition of the earlier wave, coming to South Asia already around 1900-1700 BCE, infiltrated into the Rigveda in its late books I and VIII-X, but is best represented in the Atharvaveda.*

-  The people of the second wave moved into the Eastern Gangetic Plain earlier than the first wave, and later created the culture of the Greater Magadha region. 

This theory raises the tantalizing possibility that the reason the first and second wave cultures were so different was due to the fact the first wave people integrated with the inhabitants of the IVC to a greater degree, since they were first to arrive to the sub-continent during the waning days of the IVC, and lived there for several hundred years before the second wave arrived. Thus it could be that some of the core beliefs of the Greater Magadha religion have their origins in the IVC. Since several of these beliefs became part of core Hindiusm after the Western and Eastern cultures merged, these ideas lay out a path by which the ancient IVC religion has influenced modern day religious practices.

There is another very interesting clue to this historical puzzle that was uncovered as a result of the genetic analysis of the DNA of the modern Indian population. This is discussed in the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769933/) *Genetic Evidence for Recent Population Mixture in India* by Reich et.al. and their findings include:

- Even though modern India has a very large population of over a billion, the people are separated into distinct genetic clusters of a few million individuals each, as a function of the caste and *jati* to which they belong. For example people from two *jatis* living a few villages apart may be as distinct genetically speaking as the Northern Europeans are from the Southern Europeans.
- The reason for this is that members within each cluster have been practicing endogamy (i.e. marrying with their groups) for a very long time, as much as 2000 years, which is from around the start of the Christian Era. Prior to this time, there was intense mixing between the groups, but this came to an abrupt halt around 0 BCE.

Reich does not speculate on what caused the genetic mixing within the Ancient Indian population to end,  but obviously the caste and *jati* based restrictions on marriage hardened at that time. But why did this happen around 0 BCE? The ideas of Bronkhorst and Parpola provide a clue to this mystery. This time period is precisely when the merger bwetween the Western Brahmanical and the Eastern Greater Magadha culture was becoming solidified. Prior to this period mixing between groups wss much more common since the religions of Greater Magadha did not recognize the strict caste system of their Western counterparts, and they dominated most of the Indian sub-continent as a result of the Mauryan Empire. But once the cultures merged under the Brahmanical umbrella, strich caste based marriage resterictions were enforced, and they have continues more or less unchanged for the last 2000 years.
