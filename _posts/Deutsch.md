# Book Review: Critical Mass, How One Thing Leads to Another by Philip Ball

Summary:
- Start by talking bout city segregation statistics in the US. Racism has gone down in the US since the 1960s, especially in metropolitan areas. The what accounts for the segregation that we see in cities?
- Talk about stock market fluctuations. Can these be caused by trading patterns rather than market fundamentals?
- Is there a science that connects macroscopic behavior to microscopis rules of interacton between individual entities?
- Beginnings of such a science: Maxwell's kinetic theory of gasses. Assumes that particles move independently, leads to Gaussian distribution. This did not explain phase transitions.
- Van der Waals theory of phase transitions. He introduced rules for interaction between particles.
- Other systems that also exhibit phase transitions: Magnetic materials, the Ising model, crowd motion,
- Traffic models, the concept of metastability
- Ch 8 on stock market models can be omitted, it does not really talk about individual interactions
- How trading patterns can cause market volatility
- The Power Law and Self Organized Criticality (SoC), non-equilibrieum models. Natural Systems that obey this law: Eartquakes, forest fires, volcanic activity
- Power Law in human systems (Zipf)
- Model for Firms, power laws in these models, how individual behavior can be used to explain rise and fall of firms

# Book Review: The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch

- Don’t agree with the multiverse hypothesis
- Most interesting part of book: Casts reality as a virtual reality rendering by a VR Machine.
- Our reality is VR rendering carried out by our brain, hence the brain is a VR machine
- Designing a synthetic VR machine is equivalent to knowing all the laws of physics etc
- Deutsch applies the theory of computation to figure out what kind of realities a VR machine can render
- Comes to the conclusion that that there an uncountable infinite number of realities that VR machines are incapable of rendering. Uses the cantor diagonal argument to do this. 
- He calls this the generalized Turing hypothesis 

Hence the noumenon is forever out of reach for us, since the brain is incapable of rendering it for us. 
We can never peer behind the curtain.

We can never peer behind the curtain.
- Considers our genes to be a type of VR renderer, the output of which is the organism itself.
- [ ] Genes not only render the organism, but through the organism also render the environment that the organism exists in.

The main strands of a TOE
- [ ] Multiverse and QM
- [ ] The generalized Turing hypothesis 
- [ ] Poppers epistemology for science
- [ ] Darwin’s theory as modified by Dawkins. Evolution works through genes, not the organism as a whole. Hence survival of the fittest applies at the gene level. 
- [ ] Deutsch says that these 4 strands are interconnected and support each other. Not completely clear to me.
