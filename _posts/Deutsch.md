# Book Review: The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch

- Donâ€™t agree with the multiverse hypothesis
- Most interesting part of book: Casts reality as a virtual reality rendering by a VR Machine.
- Our reality is VR rendering carried out by our brain, hence the brain is a VR machine
- Designing a synthetic VR machine is equivalent to knowing all the laws of physics etc
- Deutsch applies the theory of computation to figure out what kind of realities a VR machine can render
- Comes to the conclusion that that there an uncountable infinite number of realities that VR machines are incapable of rendering. Uses the cantor diagonal argument to do this. 
- He calls this the generalized Turing hypothesis 

Hence the noumenon is forever out of reach for us, since the brain is incapable of rendering it for us. 
We can never peer behind the curtain.
