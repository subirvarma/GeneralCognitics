In the past few hundred years, our civilization has achieved enormous progress in Science and Technology. Part of this progress can be attributed to our ability to build sophisticated mathematical models for the natural world. In order to build these models, Scientists have to work within a framework that describes fundamental entities such as Time and Space. One such framework was introduced by Newton, and goes by the name of Absolute Time and Absolute Space, and subsequent theories such Einstein's Theory of Relativity, have replaced it with newer frameworks. In parallel with Scientists, Philosophers have been theorizing about the nature of reality, and the reason for the effectiveness of our theoretical models in describing reality. This path leads from Descartes to David Hume and Immanuel Kant, and to more modern philosophers. The importance of the philosophical considerations behind the ideas of Modern Science assumed particular urgence with the discovery of Quantum Mechanics about hundred years ago. This new science completely upended our ideas about reality, even more than Relativity, and Scientists and Philosophers are still arguing about what the equations of Quantum Mechanics even mean.

My objective in this essay is to summarize the current thinking in these areas, and what it means for our understanding of reality. A deeper understanding of the framework for Science has become even more urgent with Artificial Intelligence and the discovery of Large Language Models (LLMs). These serve as models for Human Language and there are open questions whether these models are actually modeling Human Cognition. Getting a better understanding of how Mathematical Models such as LLMs relate to reality and our perceptions of reality is critical in resolving these questions. 

Here is a brief definition of the main actors in this drama:

- Base Reality: This is sum total of what exists in the Universe. 
- Our Perceived Reality: Information from Base Reality impinges on our senses, and our brain puts it all together (using a process that is largely mysterious), to create the world as we see, hear and feel it.
- Mathematics and Mathematical Models: Mathematics can be defined as a self-consistent system of thought we have built, operating using the rules of logic. It can be used to create models of our Perceived Reality, as was discovered by Galileo and Newton more than 300 years ago.
- Human Cognition: Our brain consists of a large number of interconnected neurons, which are somehow able to create our Perceived Reality, and enables us to exist in it.
- Artificial Neural Networks: These are also Mathematical models, but of a special kind. They also model our Perceived Reality, but these models are very different than the classical Newtonian models.

  The rest of this essay is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss the Penrose framework for Scientific Knowledge, which proposes a relationship between Perceived Reality, Human Conition and Mathematical Models. Section 3 is on the relationship between Base Reality and Perceived Reality as discussed by Kant and others, Section 4 is on Mathematical Models of Reality and our current understanding of good these models are in describing it. We propose a modification to Penrose's framework in Section 5, and in Section 6 we add LLMs to the mix and discuss how it might fit within this modified framework.

## The Kantian Framework

Immanuel Kant set out for himself the task to discovering the limits of human knowledge and the result was his book "Critique of Pure Reason", that was published almost 250 years ago. In this he theorized that our perception of reality, which he called Phenomenon, is not the same as Base Reality, which he called Noumenon. Morever, it is not possible for us to gain access to the Noumenon, since all interactions with are mediated through our perceptual senses. Hence what we perceive is the world that our brain creates using the information coming through our senses. However this information is very different than the world that we actually perceive, for example when we see a red object in front of us, the sensation of redness is not part of the light waves coming from that object.
Fundamental to our perception of the world are the concepts of Space (or the fact that objects have an extension in space) and Time (or the fact that events have a duration in time). Kant claimed that Space and Time are purely comcepts created by our brain, and do not exist in the Noumenon. Hence our image of reality is not the same as reality. Our perceptions are not things in the world, they are versions of those things that we construct in our minds by shaping them in space and time.

Since the time that Kant came up with these ideas, there has been a lot of philosophical debate about them. The fact that the Noumenon cannot be directly accesses using our senses means that we cannot perform any experiment that confirms its existence. Since the time of Kant there have been developments in Physics and Cognitive Science that seem to point in this direction. In Physics the discoveries of Quantum Mechanics seem to paint a picture of the world at the atomic level that is very different than our perceptual world. It is not clear whether this is indeed confirmation of the Noumenon, since even in Quantum Mechanics the theory has to be confirmed by experiments which we access through our senses. Hence it can be argued that instruments such as the Electron Microscope do not give us acces to the Noumenon, but just expand the reach of our senses. In the next section we present work that argue that it is a mistake to assume that the equations of Quantum Mechanics (or other modern theories such as General Relativity) present a picture of the Noumenon, they are merely mathematical constructs or models of our perceived reality.

The other domain of science that might shed light on the existence of the Noumenon is Cognitive Science, which is the study of how the neurons in our brain process information. There are numerous experiments that show that our color perception changes as a function of the type of lighting in the environment, also our perception of movement can be fooled by specially designed patterns. The study of perception in other animals also shows that there are creatures whose perception of the world is very different than ours. In general Cognitive Science does not present us with any irrefutable evidence for the existence of the Noumenon, but it does make it plausible to see how an interconnected network of billions of neurons might be able to create the world that we perceive.

Kant himself did not argue for the existence of the Noumenon using empirical experiments, but instead relied on rhetoric and phiolosopical arguments. His main arguments are known as Kant's Antinomies which are logical contradictions that arise when we confuse the phenomenal world and the noumenal world. Since the time of Kant the idea of the Noumenon has been much debated. It actually agrees with a lot of Eastern Phiolosophy, particularly the main ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism. Philosophers such as Hegel and Nietzsche have objected to the way Kant separated the world in two layers, and since the Noumenon layer is effectively unknowable, it is irrelevant to practical philosophy.

The book " The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant and the Ultimate Nature of Reality" has an excellent description of the main elements of Kant's philosophy, and also has a fascinating discussion of the similarities between that, the short stories of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges and basic ideas behind Quantum Maechanics as formulated by Werner Heisenberg. The following discussion of Kant's ideas borrows heavily from the presentation in this book:

For sensory input to become knowledge of the world requires that objects be located in respect to other things and that events be sequenced as coming before, afer or simultaneous to other events. But locating objects with respect to one another in space, or sequencing events in time, is something that pure sense perception on its own cannot accomplish. This exposure needs to be organized in order to experience it.
In order to experience the spatial relations between objects we implicitly assume that they exist together in a shared space. However space itself is not an object of experience, but the very condition for experiencing objects. Space (and time) are like representations that our brain creates so that we can experience reality.
Consciousness is another entity creates by our minds in order to create a timeline that unifies our experiences and orders our perceptions.

We make a fundamental error by assuming that Space and Time are objects in themselves that exist in Base Reality, just like other objects that we see around us. But instead Space and Time are created by our brains as a way to mediate between the chaotic amount of data that is constantly impinging on our senses, by organizing them within this space-time framework or representation. Several classical paradoxes, such as that of Zeno, arise because of our tendency to objectify Space-Time, followed by our application of the mathematical idea of infinite divisibility, to conclude that space-time can be divided into smaller and smaller segments infinitely many times. However the idea of infinite divisibility is also not part of the Phenomenon, it exists purely in the world of Mathematical concepts. The Laws of Physics are really the laws of our observations of how things behave in our Perceived Reality. There is a very nice quote by Heisenberg in this regard: "We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning".

A nice metaphor for Kant's ideas of Space-Time is the way in which we use Cartesian co-ordinates to represent objects in geometry. Clearly the co-ordinate system is not another object, but instead it is an abstraction used to organize the objects that exist in mathematical space. Morever the co-ordinate system is not unique, in the sense that we can choose some other system, such as Polar Co-ordinates if we think that it supplies a better representation.

Once we accept the idea that Space-Time is not part of the Noumenon, but instead are constructs created by our brains to organize sensory data, then the question arises, what exactly is in the Noumenon? To this Kant's response is: We don't know, and we can never know. If we were to exist in the Noumenon, then we would have the ability to operate outside the limitations of Space and Time. However all of our knowledge comes from operating within the limitations of time and space. Operating outside it would mean seeing everything simultaneously or knowing all time in an instant, which would obliterate the very connection between objects and instances that constitutes knowledge. Since an observation is always an observation in time and space, the Laws of Physics are all about operations in time and space. We may speculate about the world outside the conditions of time and space, but nontemporal and nonspatial perspectives obliterate the very idea of an observation, and hence are incompatible with any knowledge we can have of the world.

Kant also believed that we could presume the existence of an object in the Noumenon, operating in unified space-time whole, even if we cannot grasp it as an object using or senses. This allows us to derive universal, necessary and true statements in areas such as Religion and Ethics, a program that Kant carried out in his later works. In Science though we are limited to studying representations that come to us through our sense of space and time, not the underlying reality.  

Kant's ideas came before the discovery of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, and so a natural question is how well they have held up in light of these theories. The short answer is that that they have held up quite well.  Einstein himslf never reconciled to the idea that the models in Physics were not describing Base Reality, hence is oft quoted remark that "God does not play dice with the universe" when he was confronted by the indeterminism at the base of Quantum Theory. 
However Heisenberg was inspired by the ideas of Kant in creating his Matrix Mechanics. His equations were derived with the objective of explaining observations of microscopic pehenomena, and did not to try to visualize a human comprehensible model that lies behind those equations. Indeed he later come up with the idea of the Uncertainity Principle that showed that our ideas of position and momentum do not extend to the microscopic world. Hence electrons and their ilk are not objects in the sense that we see around us, and it is impossible for us to visualize what they are, since they don't fall into any of the categories of objects that we are familar with. This sounds a little bit like Kant's ideas of the Noumenon, since that too contains things that we can't visualize. However this is difference between the two, namely that the microscopic objects still exist within the framework of space-time and their properties can be accessed using scientific instruments and hence cannot be part of the Noumenon. Hence it is still part of the Phenomemon, but the entities that it describes are so outside the realm of our daily experience that our language does not have the words to describe them.
But the very fact that Physics has come up with objects that exist in our Perceived Reality, but we are not able to visualize what they are or look like, lends credibility to Kant's ideas that there exist things that are beyond the reach of our perceptual senses.

Note that Kant did not deny the existence of an objective reality that exists out there. and is common to all of us. His main point was that this reality is not accessible to us since our brain creates a curtain between us and this reality. There are philosophical schools that actually deny the existence of any reality alltogether, such as Silopsism. If that were the case then objective Science would be impossible.

Figure 1

Fig. 1 summarizes the discussion: It shows signals such as light and sound waves coming from the Noumenon which impinge on our senses. These are then processed by the brain, which abstracts the deluge of data, and presents a picture of reality to us which is tailored so as to help us survive in our environment. Since all data coming from the Noumenon is filtered through the brain, we cannot get direct access to the Noumenon.

## Mathematical Models of Reality vs Perception of Reality

Kant's ideas were developed about a hundred years after the start of modern science with Newton and Galileo. Science developed and made progress using a different framework than the one proposed by Kant, called Cartesian Dualism. This framework achieved great success and gave us the modern world. However as described later in the section, it has run into problems in recent times, which have led people to re-examine the basic ideas behind the framework.

Galileo and Newton made a monumental discovery more than 400 years ago, which is that Laws of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description (taking Kant's lessons into account, this statement should be modified to state that the Laws of our Perception of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description). This adds another actor to our drama, namely the space of Mathematical Systems. 

What is a Mathematical System? These are systems that contain objects, that are defined soley by the way they interact with other objects. The interaction is in terms of mathematical operations (that differ from system to system). The work of Mathematicians consists of deriving interesting properties of the system using rules of logic. 
At one time it was thought that Mathematical Systems reflect our reality, in the sense that the objects and rules in the system were abstractions of objects and rules in the the real world. However this prejudice  was exploded in the 19th century when mathematicians came up with Non-Eucledian Geometries and Number Systems that has nothing to do with what we see around us, but were studied purely because they resulted in interesting mathematical results. Some of these systems later found applications in modeling Nature, much to the surprise of scientists. In this section we explore this aspect of our scientific knowledge which results in questions such as: Why does Nature seem to obey mathematical laws? What is the connection between the objects used in mathematical systems used to model nature, and the actual objects found in nature? Do mathematical models of nature represent reality, and if so is it the Phenomenon or the Noumenon?

Figure 2

Our tale begins with Rene Descartes, the founder of co-ordinate gemetry and Cartesian co-ordinates, which was one of his many achievements. Descartes also came up with the idea of Cartesian Dualism, which is illustrated in Fig. 2. His big idea was to banish the brain (and consciousness) from within the domain of Science so that explanations for subjective sensations such as color and smell was placed outside the scope of Science. Instead Science was to limit itself to modeling the objective aspects of Nature, such as mass, length or time, which could be measured in a precise manner using instruments. 
Descartes was motivated by several objectives in making this proposal. One big motivation was probably to keep the mind outside the Scientific purview and make it part of the religous world, which was probably wise given what had happened to Bruno and Galileo around the same time that Descartes lived. Another motivation was to accelerate the progress of Science by limiting it things which could be measured in an objective fashion. Other aspects of this framework include:

- Nature exists independent of our minds, and the job of the scientist was to discover the eternal Laws of Nature which have existed from the beginning of time.
- Nature can be modeled using mathematics. Galileo had a nice quote in this regard, "The Laws of Nature are written in the language of mathematics".

Descartes idea of duality was accepted by the Scientific Community, and for the next 300 years led to the massive progress in science and technology. Scientists thought that by discovering the mathematical Laws of Nature they were plumbing the depths of reality, so that indeed reality at its very core was a set of mathematical equations. 

But Cartesian Duality also created several deep mysteries:

- How does the physical world create the mental world of sensations? The Cartesian Model assumes that the mental world exists independently of the physical world, and what we perceive is a true picture of the physical world. Hence even subjective sensations such as color or smell are part of the physical world, and our mind creates a faithful representation of this reality. But then the mathematical models that do such a good job in explaining objective aspects of reality completely fail in modeling subjective sensations (there is no equation that captures the sense of 'redness" in a rose for example).
- Why does Nature obey the Laws of Mathematics? Even though mathematics is entirely a creation of the human brain, Nature at the most fundamental level seems to obey the equations of Mathematics.

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant13.png) 

Figure 3

The Cartesian Framework has undergone a few changes since the seventeenth century, and a good alternative framework that is based on it was proposed by the eminent physisct Roger Penrose which was described in his book "The Road to Reality", and this is shown in Fig. 3. The Penrose Framework states that:

- Our mental world creates the world of mathematical objects. Since the time of Descartes there has been a recognition that Mathematical Systems are a creation of the human mind and do not have some sort of Platonic existence of their own. 
- A subset of the world of mathematical objects serves as a model for the physical world or reality. This belief remains unchanged since the seventeenth century, and has actually become stronger given the successes it has had since then. In fact a stronger version of this belief is that the Physical World at its core is nothing else but a set of mathematical equations.
- The physical world has its own objective reality independent of the mental world, and this is what we perceive. Again this aspect of the framework is unchanged from before.
- A subset of the physical world serves as our mental world since our brain is part of the physical world. This is the most important change from the Cartesian Framework, and it banishes the mind-matter split.

The first crack in the Framework happened in the beginning years of the 20th century, with the discovery of energy quanta by Max Plack. Within a few years of that, Einstein proposed that light exhibits both wave and particle properties, and indeed within a couple of decades experiments were conducted that showed that material particles like electrons also have wavelike properties such wavelength. This raised a conundrum since for the first time the fundamental constituents of nature had a form that could not be visualized by us humans. Soon after this Heisenberg followed by Schrodinger proposed a mathematical description of quantum phenomena that was unlike any theory that had come before. Schrodinger's version of the theory was based on a fundamental quantity called the Wave Function (or $\psi$) whose nature was completely mysterious. After a lot of debate, Max Born proposed that the square of the wave function gave the probability of the quantum system being in particular  state, which meant that the movement of microscopic particles  was fundamentally random.
Since this discovery most scientists working with Quantum Mechanics don't concern themselves with the problem of interpreting what the Wave Function means, but instead use the maxim "Shut up and Calculate", since just following the mathematical rules behind the theory leads to excellent agreements with experiment in every case. 

In parallel several interpretations of Quantum Mechanics have been proposed, the most prominent being what is called the Copenhagen Interpretation. This does not try to explain the wave-particle duality, but simply states that the particle can exhibit either depending upon the experiment being performed. A quantum particle that is not being observed can be in a superposition of several states at the same time, and does not settle into a definite state until it is observed. This leads to the paradox of Schrodinger's Cat being dead and alive at the same time (this has been tested experimentally with the Aspect experiments which resulted in the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics, not with a cat though :-)).  The Copenhagen Interpretation also states that the wave function is an objective (i.e., observer independent) measure of the uncertainity that we have about the Quantum World, and this uncertainity vanishes for objects in the macro world, in other words Quantum Mechanics comes into effect for microscopic objects but is not relevant at normal scales. This last claim of the Copenhagen Interpretation has been experimentally shown to be false, so that even macro objects can exhibit wave particle duality.

The Copenhagen Interpretation is a way to shove the interpretive problems in Quantum Theory under the rug, and proceed with the day to day applications of the theory which work well. However one can think of experiments in which the Copenhagen Interpretation fails, and the most well known of these is known as the problem of Wigner's Friend, which is as follows: Assume that there is a closed box containing a quantum particle that can be in one of two states, and and an Observer 1 who is located out side the box. In addition the system containing the box and Observer 1 is itself in a larger box which is closed to the outside. There is also a second observer, say Observer 2 (Wigner's friend) who is located outside the larger box. Lets say Observer 1 at some point opens the box and finds that the partcle is in State 1, at this point the Wave Function from Observer 1's point of view has 'collapsed' since there is no more uncertainity about the state of the partcle. However Observer 2 does not know this, and from his point of view, the combined system consisting of the particle and Observer 1 can be one of several possible quantum states. From this experiment it follows that there is no single observer independent interpretation of the wave function, i.e., the wave function is an a subjective measure of uncertainity in a quantum system, and cannot be separated from the observer. This is precisely the Quantum Bayesianism or Qbism interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that was proposed recently. According to Qbism the wave function is a subjective measure of Quantum Uncertainity and exists only in the mind of the observer, and is not really part of nature as such. This strikes at the heart of the Cartesian (and Penrosian) Framework since we can no longer claim that Science is discovering Laws of Nature that are independent of our mind. 

The Penrosian Framework opens the possibility of modeling the mind using mathematical models: Since the Framework says that the mind is part of the Physical Worldand all of the Physical World can be modeledusing mathematics, then what is the mathematicalmodel for the mind?  How can a set of physical processes happening within the brain give rise to our subjective experiences and consciousness? And therein lies the great mystery: The mechanism by which the brain creates our reality and its subjective sensations has no explanation within modern science, which is referred to as the "Hard Problem of Consciousness". In order to explain the mind, perhaps we need a new framework for science as a whole. The first steps in this direction  were actually taken by Kant 250 years ago, but his lessons have either been ignored or mis-understood since then. In the next section we discuss this in detail.

## A Kantian Framework for Science

A basic feature of the Cartesian Framework is that subjective experiences are kept outside the purview of Science. Kant on the otyher hand rejected this idea in his works, and instead suggested that the world that we see around us has no objective existence independent of our perception of it. Indeed our perception of nature is a creation of our minds hence all experiences flow from this. Hence subjective experiences such as that of color are no less a part of nature, as are 'concrete' qualities such as mass of volume. Hence the mind-matter duality does not exist, because there is no mysterious leap happening from 'objective' physical objects like light waves striking our retina, to the subjective experience of color. Both light waves and the color perception are creations of our mind. The color red for example now is part of nature, as much as concrete obects that we find around us. Hence the correct question to be asking is "Given that light of a certain wavelength strikes or retina, how does the activity we see in the brain translate this into the color red?" In this picture the light wave is no less a creation of the brain,as is the color red.

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant9.png) 

Figure 4

This Kantian view of Science is illustrated in Figure 4. There is no longer a split between Mind and Matter, all our experiences are a creation of our minds and hence can classified as Subjective. The discussion of Quantum Mechanics in the previous section shows that at the very deepest levels our experience of Nature is inded a subjective one. There is indeed an Objective Reality, Kant's Noumenon, that exists beyond our perception, and the world that we see is derived from that. However the Mathematical Theories of Nature that we come up with are not describing the Noumenon, but are instead tieed to our individual perceptions created by our brains. This might also explain why Mathematics is so effective ion modeling Nature, this is because both Mathematics and Nature are creations of our minds. 

(https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant1.jpg) 

The ideas that were described above were first expressed by the British phiolosopher A.N. Whitehead about hundred years ago. This subject is also discussed in the book "The Blind Spot: Why Science Cannot Explain Human Experience" by Frank, Gleiser and Thompson. The Blind Spot that they refer to consists of several things inluding what they call the Bifurcatioon of Nature in subjective and objective experiences, which is the same as the idea of Cartesian Dualism. 

If we ignore the Noumenon in Fig. 4, the rest of the figure looks similar to Penrose's model in Fig. 3, with one exception: Whereas Penrose's model allows the mind to exist as part of Reality, but rules out the possibility that Reality is itself a creation of the mind. The Kantian framework on the other hand alllows for both possibilities, i.e., Reality is a creation of the Mind, and at the same time the Mind is one of the objects that exists in Reality. This is loop is ofen referred to as a "Strange Loop" in Cognitive Philosophy.

Another aspect of the Blind Spot is mistaking the Mathematical Model of Nature for Nature itself, which another very important point. When Physicsts write down mathematical equations for their theories, they are not capturing "God's Thoughts" in these equations. Since the equations were derived by abstracting away aspects of the reality that we around us, they cannoty contain more information than that reality. Hence all models in Physics are approximations of our Perceived Reality, we get closer to modeling relaity as our moidels become more sophisticated, but we can never equal it. Note that we are not even talking about modeling the Base Reality using our equations, since we have no access to it behind the veil that our consciousness throws around us. Elevating mathematical constructs to the ststus of fundamental reality is called Surreptiuous Substitution. In this way of thinking the Perceptual World is demoted to subjective appearance, while reality is what the equations of the theory describe. As Frank et.al put it, this is a mistake, the abstract can never explain or ground the concrete.

Even though Frank et.al. leave out Kant in most of the discussion in their book, their ideas in my opinion have a deeply Kantian flavor and is in some sense the extension of Kant's thinking to the modern age. In common with Kant they give primacy to our subjective experiences. Whereas Kant proposed the source of those experiences as the Noumenon or Base Reality, Frank et.al. instead talk about the relation between Mathematical Models of Perceived Reality vs Perceived Reality itself. In this framework (originally Whiteheads's), perceived reality can be considered to a type of Noumenon, while our Mathematical Theories capture some but not all of it. Hence we should never make conclusions about perceived reality using our mathematical theory beyond the reach of our perception (and experimental data). This is a mistake that we make all the time when we come up Mathematical Theories that are not tied to observations such as String Theory, or theories that have to do with the very early universe. Hence just as Kant said that Noumenon is fount from which all of reality arises through the prism of our consciousness, our perceived reality is the fount from which out Mathematical Theories come from, but we should never mistake the theory for the real thing. Our perceived reality is an abstraction that our mind creates from the information that it collects from the Noumenon, while Mathematical Models of Reality are a further level of abstraction that we create in order to model Nature. In each case the abstraction can approximate the world that it is trying to model, but it can only approach this ideal depending upon how good the model is. In this framework the work of Science is never exhausted, since we can keep coming up with better and better models of reality, without ever getting to a final model, or Theory of Everything.

The Kantian Framework allows for creating mathematical models of the Mind, since the Mind is one of the objects that exists in our Perceived Reality. What will such a Model look like? In the next Section we take a stab at answering this question by looking at the emerging science of Artificial Neural Networks.

## Incorporating Models of the Mind into the Kantian Framework

In the previous section we described a Kantian Framework for Science that takes into account the fact the Mind is one of the objects that exists in our perceived reality, and hence we should try to model it using the tools of Mathematical Modeling, just as we have done for the other objects that exists in Perceived Reality. The Mind is special case, since we are using the Mind itself is responsible for creating perceived reality, and hence in a sense it is trying to model itself within the confines of the perceptual boundaries that it has created.

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant10.png) 

Figure 5

Fig. 5 is a modification to Fig. 4 in which I have added the Mind as another object in our Perceived Reality. The picture posits that Mathematical Models that have proven so successful in modeling the physical world, can also be extended to model the Mind. The Mathematical Models that we have come up with for the Physical World take the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). But what kind of models can we use for the Mind?

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant11.png) 

Figure 6

Fig. 6 proposes that Mathematical Models for the Mind take the form of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNS). These models are fundamentally different than the PDEs and point to a radically different way for building models. Even though the PDE models for physical reality make use of advanced mathematics, at their root they are simple, in the sense that they are able to model complex physical phenomena using only a few equations with tens of parameters. It can be argued that the reason why this is even possible is because of the a priori structure that our minds create in order to organize the cahos of data coming from the Noumenon. According to Kant these structures include our perceptions of Space and Time which simplifies physical models quite a bit, since these imply that all intercation between entities in the model is limited to those entities that are in the neigborhood of each other. Without this assumnption building mathematical models of physical reality would be impossible.
However we cannot make any such assumption in the case of models for the mind, and indeed Atrificial Neural Networks incorporate models for nodes that are able to interact with all other nodes in the model, which makes these models complex. We also need billions of parameters to model all these interactions, so these models are very different than the PDE models. Our minds come with some pre-existing structure when we are born (including the concepts of Space and Time), which ahs been built up over hundreds of years of evolution. But this is not the case for ANNs, when we start the training for these, all their neuronal connections are set to random values. WHich is why it takes so much a data to train ANN, in some sense we are trying to reproduce the gradual process of evolution within a space of a dew days.

The way that the Neural Network models are specified is through training using a large Training Data Set as shown in Fig. 6, which again differentiuates them from PDE models. In some sense the Training Data can be considered the be the equivalent of the Nuomenon for ANNs. Just as our mind organizes the chaos of the Noumenon using structures as Space and Time, similarly ANNs must use some organizing principle to structure the chaos of data from their Training Data Sets. What are these organizing principles? Are they similar to the concept of Space and Time that emerge in our minds? This requires an update to [Nagle's question "What is it like to be a bat?"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Nagel_Bat.pdf) to "What is it like to be an Artificial Neural Network?"






## How to LLMs Fit Within the Framework?

- Kant's Theory of Knowledge and Kant's Antinomies
- Physical Models of the World
- LLMs and a Model for Language
- How would LLMs fit within Kant's framework
- Implications for AGI


## Kant's Theory of Knowledge

- Base reality (Neumenon)  is not the same as perceived reality (Phenomenon)
- Certain problems in perceived reality have no solution (cannot be resolved as either true or false), since they use concepts of space and time that do not exist in base reality (Kant’s antinomies)
- Base reality is not accessible through our senses

## Kant and Modern Physics

- Mathematical models of perceived reality (Physics) are not the same as perceived reality
- The deepest level of reality that physics posits is the quantum wave function.
- Is the wave function real? It is clearly not part of perceived reality, is it part of base reality, ie part of Kant’s Neumenon. 
- The QBism framework for quantum mechanics resolves the wave particle duality problem by stating that the wave function is not part of either perceived or base reality. It is a subjective measure of how likely an event might happen, and is tied to our perception.
- Cosmology: Are we justified in extrapolating our models of physics to speculate about the beginnings of the universe? No, these models only work so far as they model our perceived reality. There is no way to verify that they work at the beginnings of the universe since our perception does not extend that far. The extrapolation is just a mathematical exercise, not tied to perceived reality. 
- Are we accessing base reality through the mathematical models? No, since that cannot be accessed even using advanced instruments such as electron microscopes and powerful telescopes 
- In biology, the chemical model of the cell is not same as the actual cell. The chemical models do not capture what makes a cell living, they are extrinsic rather than intrinsic. 
- No danger that one day science will exhaust all that there is to know, since we can only get closer to the base reality, but never reach it. 
- There is some unknown factor that makes a cell alive, chemical models are nowhere close to discovering this.

## Artificial Neural Networks and LLMs

- The ANN is a model for human cognition
- Extending Kant’s thinking: The ANN can never be the same as cognition
- Mistaking ANNs for cognition can lead to antinomies
- But ANNs can approximate cognition
- Perceived Reality —> Language model of Perceived Reality —> LLM model of language 
- There is some unknown factor that makes the biological brain conscious, ANN models are not close to discovering this
- Can Integrated Information Theory ( IIT) be used as a measure of how close an ANN is to human cognition 

## LLMs within a Kantian Framework

Three latent spaces
1. latent space of perception of reality, either images or language or both together 
2. Latent space of reality is physics
3. Latent spaces of mathematics 
4. Our brain

- latent space of models of reality (physics) can be mapped on to a subset of the latent space of mathematics
- Our brain creates a mapping from perceptions to the latent space of perceptions . The points of this latent space are stored in the brain. 
- Mathematical latent  space is a creation of our brain

There are two latent spaces of reality
- Space 1 is a mapping in the brain to individual points of our perception of reality 
- Space 2 is a mathematical mapping, that is useful for doing predictions (physics). This is a mapping from our perception of reality to latent spaces of physics. 
- The mathematical space used in 2 is also a creation of the brain
- Hence physics does the following: 1) identify mathematical objects that can map to our perceptions of reality, such as fields, groups etc 2) Come up with mathematical equations that work on the mathematical objects and can be used for doing predictions (involving time and space)
- Are the regularities that we observe in nature a creation of the human brain? Then it makes sense that another human creation, ie mathematics, can be used to describe those regularities
- These regularities exist in time and space, and according to Kant, the these are a creation of the brain
