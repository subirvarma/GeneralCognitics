# What Would Kant Think of LLMs?

## Introduction

- Introduce the main actors: Reality, Perception of Reality, Mathematical Spaces, Mathematical Models of Reality, Consciousness
- Penrose's Framework
- Confusion between Mathematical Models of Reality and Perception of Reality, as explained in the "The Blind Spot" and "Putting Ourselves Back in the Equation"
- Confusion between Reality and Perception of Reality, as explained in "The Rigor of Angels"
- Modification of the Penrose's framework
- How do LLMs fit within the framework

In the past few hundred years, our civilization has achieved enormous progress in Science and Technology. Part of this progress can be attributed to our ability to build sophisticated mathematical models for the natural world, which is part of the Science of Physics. In order to build these models, Scientists have to work within a framework that describes fundamental entities such as Time and Space. One such framework was introduced by Newton, and goes by the name of Absolute Time and Absolute Space, and subsequent theories such Einstein's Theory of Relativity, have replaced it with newer frameworks. In parallel with Scientists, Philosophers have been theorizing about the nature of reality, and the reason for the effectiveness of our theoretical models in describing reality. This path leads from Descartes to David Hume and Immanuel Kant, and to more modern philosophers. The importance of the philosophical considerations behind the ideas of Modern Science assumed particular urgence with the discovery of Quantum Mechanics about hundred years ago. This new science completely upended our ideas about reality, even more than Relativity, and Scientists and Philosophers are still arguing about what the equations of Quantum Mechanics even mean.

My objective in this essay is to summarize the current thinking in these areas, and what it means for our understanding of reality. A deeper understanding of the framework for Science has become even more urgent with Artificial Intelligence and the discovery of Large Language Models (LLMs). These serve as models for Human Cognition and there are open questions whether these models are actually conscious. Getting a better understanding of how Mathematical Models such as LLMs relate to reality and our perceptions of reality is critical in resolving these questions. 

Here is a brief definition of the main actors in this drama:

- Base Reality: This is sum total of what exists in the Universe. 
- Our Perceived Reality: Information from Base Reality impinges on our senses, and our brain puts it all together (using a process that is largely mysterious), to create the world as we see, hear and feel it.
- Mathematics and Mathematical Models: Mathematics can be defined as a self-consistent system of thought we have built, operating using the rules of logic. It can be used to create models of our Perceived Reality, as was discovered by Galileo and Newton more than 300 years ago.
- Human Cognition: Our brain consists of a large number of interconnected neurons, which are somehow able to create our Perceived Reality, and enables us to exist in it.
- Large Language Models: These are also Mathematical models, but of a special kind. Instead of modeling our Perceived Reality, they model human generated language, and they seem to have emergent ability to model cognition itself.

## A Proposed Framework




## How to LLMs Fit Within the Framework?

- LLMs as a Mathematical Model for Human Cognition








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Kant's Theory of Knowledge and Kant's Antinomies
- Physical Models of the World
- LLMs and a Model for Language
- How would LLMs fit within Kant's framework
- Implications for AGI


## Kant's Theory of Knowledge

- Base reality (Neumenon)  is not the same as perceived reality (Phenomenon)
- Certain problems in perceived reality have no solution (cannot be resolved as either true or false), since they use concepts of space and time that do not exist in base reality (Kant’s antinomies)
- Base reality is not accessible through our senses

## Kant and Modern Physics

- Mathematical models of perceived reality (Physics) are not the same as perceived reality
- The deepest level of reality that physics posits is the quantum wave function.
- Is the wave function real? It is clearly not part of perceived reality, is it part of base reality, ie part of Kant’s Neumenon. 
- The QBism framework for quantum mechanics resolves the wave particle duality problem by stating that the wave function is not part of either perceived or base reality. It is a subjective measure of how likely an event might happen, and is tied to our perception.
- Cosmology: Are we justified in extrapolating our models of physics to speculate about the beginnings of the universe? No, these models only work so far as they model our perceived reality. There is no way to verify that they work at the beginnings of the universe since our perception does not extend that far. The extrapolation is just a mathematical exercise, not tied to perceived reality. 
- Are we accessing base reality through the mathematical models? No, since that cannot be accessed even using advanced instruments such as electron microscopes and powerful telescopes 
- In biology, the chemical model of the cell is not same as the actual cell. The chemical models do not capture what makes a cell living, they are extrinsic rather than intrinsic. 
- No danger that one day science will exhaust all that there is to know, since we can only get closer to the base reality, but never reach it. 
- There is some unknown factor that makes a cell alive, chemical models are nowhere close to discovering this.

## Artificial Neural Networks and LLMs

- The ANN is a model for human cognition
- Extending Kant’s thinking: The ANN can never be the same as cognition
- Mistaking ANNs for cognition can lead to antinomies
- But ANNs can approximate cognition
- Perceived Reality —> Language model of Perceived Reality —> LLM model of language 
- There is some unknown factor that makes the biological brain conscious, ANN models are not close to discovering this
- Can Integrated Information Theory ( IIT) be used as a measure of how close an ANN is to human cognition 

## LLMs within a Kantian Framework

Three latent spaces
1. latent space of perception of reality, either images or language or both together 
2. Latent space of reality is physics
3. Latent spaces of mathematics 
4. Our brain

- latent space of models of reality (physics) can be mapped on to a subset of the latent space of mathematics
- Our brain creates a mapping from perceptions to the latent space of perceptions . The points of this latent space are stored in the brain. 
- Mathematical latent  space is a creation of our brain

There are two latent spaces of reality
- Space 1 is a mapping in the brain to individual points of our perception of reality 
- Space 2 is a mathematical mapping, that is useful for doing predictions (physics). This is a mapping from our perception of reality to latent spaces of physics. 
- The mathematical space used in 2 is also a creation of the brain
- Hence physics does the following: 1) identify mathematical objects that can map to our perceptions of reality, such as fields, groups etc 2) Come up with mathematical equations that work on the mathematical objects and can be used for doing predictions (involving time and space)
- Are the regularities that we observe in nature a creation of the human brain? Then it makes sense that another human creation, ie mathematics, can be used to describe those regularities
- These regularities exist in time and space, and according to Kant, the these are a creation of the brain
