- How do LLMs fit within the framework

In the past few hundred years, our civilization has achieved enormous progress in Science and Technology. Part of this progress can be attributed to our ability to build sophisticated mathematical models for the natural world. In order to build these models, Scientists have to work within a framework that describes fundamental entities such as Time and Space. One such framework was introduced by Newton, and goes by the name of Absolute Time and Absolute Space, and subsequent theories such Einstein's Theory of Relativity, have replaced it with newer frameworks. In parallel with Scientists, Philosophers have been theorizing about the nature of reality, and the reason for the effectiveness of our theoretical models in describing reality. This path leads from Descartes to David Hume and Immanuel Kant, and to more modern philosophers. The importance of the philosophical considerations behind the ideas of Modern Science assumed particular urgence with the discovery of Quantum Mechanics about hundred years ago. This new science completely upended our ideas about reality, even more than Relativity, and Scientists and Philosophers are still arguing about what the equations of Quantum Mechanics even mean.

My objective in this essay is to summarize the current thinking in these areas, and what it means for our understanding of reality. A deeper understanding of the framework for Science has become even more urgent with Artificial Intelligence and the discovery of Large Language Models (LLMs). These serve as models for Human Language and there are open questions whether these models are actually modeling Human Cognition. Getting a better understanding of how Mathematical Models such as LLMs relate to reality and our perceptions of reality is critical in resolving these questions. 

Here is a brief definition of the main actors in this drama:

- Base Reality: This is sum total of what exists in the Universe. 
- Our Perceived Reality: Information from Base Reality impinges on our senses, and our brain puts it all together (using a process that is largely mysterious), to create the world as we see, hear and feel it.
- Mathematics and Mathematical Models: Mathematics can be defined as a self-consistent system of thought we have built, operating using the rules of logic. It can be used to create models of our Perceived Reality, as was discovered by Galileo and Newton more than 300 years ago.
- Human Cognition: Our brain consists of a large number of interconnected neurons, which are somehow able to create our Perceived Reality, and enables us to exist in it.
- Large Language Models: These are also Mathematical models, but of a special kind. Instead of modeling our Perceived Reality, they model human generated language, and they seem to have emergent ability to model cognition itself.

  The rest of this essay is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss the Penrose framework for Scientific Knowledge, which proposes a relationship between Perceived Reality, Human Conition and Mathematical Models. Section 3 is on the relationship between Base Reality and Perceived Reality as discussed by Kant and others, Section 4 is on Mathematical Models of Reality and our current understanding of good these models are in describing it. We propose a modification to Penrose's framework in Section 5, and in Section 6 we add LLMs to the mix and discuss how it might fit within this modified framework.

## The Penrose Framework

Figure 1

The eminent physicst Roger Penrose proposed a framework for Scientific Knowledge in his book "The Road to Reality", and this is shown in Fig. 1. In order to map the objects in this framework to our earlier definitions, The Mental World corresponds to what we called Human Cognition, the Platonic Mathematical World is the same as our definition of Mathematics and Mathematical Models, while the Physical World corresponds to what we called Perceived Reality. LLMs didn't exist at the time this book was written, so un-surprisingly they are missing. The other missing object in Penrose's diagram is what we called Base Reality. Penrose beleives that Base Reality and Perceived Reality are one and the same, which explains this. We will discuss the implications of this belief in the following section. 

The Penrose Framework posits that:

- Our Mental World creates the world of Mathematical Objects (arrow 3). Some believe that Mathematical Objects have an existence of theor own, independent of human cognition, and Mathematicians are merely discovering them. 
- A subset of the World of Mathematical Objects serves as a model the Physical World (arrow 1). Everything in the Physical World can be modeled using these models.
- A subset of the Physical World serves as our Mental World since our brain is part of the Physical World (arrow 2).

## Perception of Reality vs Base Reality

Immanuel Kant set out for himself the task to discovering the limits of human knowledge and the result was his book "Critique of Pure Reason", that was published almost 250 years ago. In this he theorized that our perception of reality, which he called Phenomenon, is not the same as Base Reality, which he called Noumenon. Morever, it is not possible for us to gain access to the Noumenon, since all interactions with are mediated through our perceptual senses. Hence what we perceive is the world that our brain creates. Fundamental to this, are the concepts of Space (or the fact that objects have an extension in space) and Time (or the fact that events have a duration in time). Kant claimed that Space and Time are purely comcepts created by our brain, and do not exist in the Noumenon. 

Since the time that Kant came up with these ideas, there has been a lot of philosophical debate about them. The fact that the Noumemnon cannot be directly accesses using our senses means that we cannot perform any experiment that confirms its existence. Since the time of Kant there have been developments in Physics and Cognitive Science that seem to point in this direction. In Physics the discoveries of Quantum Mechanics seem to paint a picture of the world at the atomic level that is very different than our perceptual world. It is not clear whether this is indeed confirmation of the Noumenon, since even in Quantum Mechanics the theory has to be confirmed by experiments which we access through our senses. Hence it can be argued that instruments such as the Elctron Microscope do not give us acces to the Noumenon, but just expand the reach of our senses. In the next section we present work that argue that it is a mistake to assume that the equations of Quantum Mechanics (or other modern theories such as General Relativity) present a picture of the Noumenon, they are merely mathematical constructs or models.

The other domain of science that might shed light on the existence of the Noumenon is Cognitive Science, which is the study of how the neurons in our brain process information. There are numerous experiments that show that our color perception changes as a function of the type of lighting in the environment, also our perception of movement can be fooled by specially designed patterns. The study of perception in other animals also shows that there are creatures whose perception of the world is very different than ours. In general Cognitive Science does not present us with any irrefutable evidence for the existence of the Noumenon, but it does make it plausible to see how an interconnected network of billions of neurons might be able to create the world that we perceive.

Kant himself did not argue for the existence of the Noumenon using empirical experiments, but instead relied on rhetoric and phiolosopical arguments. His main arguments are known as Kant's Antinomies which are logical contradictions that arise when we confuse the phenomenal world and the noumenal world. Since the time of Kant the idea of the Noumenon has been much debated. It actually agrees with a lot of Eastern Phiolosophy, particularly the main ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism. Philosophers such as Hegel and Nietzsche have objected to the way Kant separated the world in two layers, and since the Noumenon layer is effectively unknowable, it is irrelevant to practical philosophy.

- An assumption that we make when we perceive something: Our image of reality is the same as reality. Kant says that our perceptions are not things in the world, they are versions of those things that we construct in our minds by shaping them in space and time. What we are reying to understand is our picture of the world.
- When we imagine reality to be identical to our perception of it, specifically when we assume that space and time are fundamentally real, our reason becomes faulty and science responds with a paradox.
- Any observation enatails connecting two disparate moments in time and space. If one is exclusively saturated in the present moment, then he wouldn't be able to observe anything at all. This connection needs to be registered by some trace or conenctor. Since an observation is always an observation in time and space, the Laws of Physics are all about operations in time and space. We may speculate about the world outside the conditions of time and space, but nontemporal and nonspatial perspectives obliterate the very idea of an observation, and hence are incompatible with any knowledge we can have of the world.
- For sensory input to become knowledge of the world requires that objects be located in respect to other things and that events be sequenced as coming before, afer or simultaneous to other events. But locating objects with respect to one another in space, or sequencing events in time, is something that pure sense perception on its own cannot accomplish. This exposure needs to be organized in order to experience it.
   (1) In order to experience the spatial relations between objects we implicitly assume that they exist together in a shared space. However space itself is not an object of experience, but the very condition for experiencing objects. It is like a representation that our brain creates so that we can experience reality.
  (2) Consciousness is another entity creates by our minds in order to create a timeline that unifies our experiences and order our perceptions.
- The Laws of Physics are really the laws of our observations of how things behave. Heisenberg quote: "We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning".
- Zeno's paradoxes arise by us assuming the solidity and continuity of spatial and temporal reality, i.e., for space time to be something real, the stuff in which change happens (it is infinitely divisible). But it is not, it is a tool that our brain creates to to relate our observations into a coherent whole.
- Difference between world of senses vs world of ideas: If we consider space time as an idea, any distance or moment can be further divided. But that is not the case when we experience space time through our senses. Kant realized the following: 
  (1) We made the mistake of treating time (then and now) and space (here and there) as part of the Noumenon
  (2) We also made the mistake of treating mathematical facts such as infinite divisibility as if though it were part of the Phenomenon.
These two mistakes taken together lead to Zeno's paradoxes.
- What would knowledge of the Noumenon, outside the constraints of time and space look like?
  (1) All of our knowledge comes from operating within the limitations of time and space. Operating outside it would mean seeing everything simultaneously or knowing all time in an instant, which would obliterate the very connection between objects and instances that constitutes knowledge.
  (2) Kant believed that we could presume the existence of an object in the Noumenon, operating in unified space-time whole, even if we cannot grasp it as an object using or senses. This will allow us to derive universal, necessary and true statements in areas such as Religion and Ethics. In Science though we are limited to studying representations that come to us through our sense of space and time, not the underlying reality.
- The atomic world is not part of the Noumenon, it is still part of the Phenomemon, but the entities that it describes are so outside the realm of our daily experience that our language does not have the words to describe them.

The book " The Rigor of Angels" has an excellent description of the main elements of Kant's philosophy, and also has a fascinating discussion of the similarities between that, the short stories of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges and basic ideas behind Quantum Maechanics as formulated by Werner Heisenberg. The following discussion of Kant's ideas borrows heavily from the presentation in this book:

For sensory input to become knowledge of the world requires that objects be located in respect to other things and that events be sequenced as coming before, afer or simultaneous to other events. But locating objects with respect to one another in space, or sequencing events in time, is something that pure sense perception on its own cannot accomplish. This exposure needs to be organized in order to experience it.

(1) In order to experience the spatial relations between objects we implicitly assume that they exist together in a shared space. However space itself is not an object of experience, but the very condition for experiencing objects. Space (and time) are like representations that our brain creates so that we can experience reality.
(2) Consciousness is another entity creates by our minds in order to create a timeline that unifies our experiences and orders our perceptions.

The Laws of Physics are really the laws of our observations of how things behave. There is a very nice quote by Heisenberg in this regard: "We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning". We make a fundamental error by assuming that Space and Time are objects in themselves that exist in Base Reality, just like other objects that we see around us. But instead Space and Time are created by our brains as a way to mediate between the chaotic amount of data that is constantly impinging on our senses, by organizing them within this space-time framework or representation. Several classical paradoxes, such as that of Zeno, arise because of our tendency to objectify Space-Time, followed by our application of the mathematical idea of infinite divisibility, to conclude that space-time can be divided into smaller and smaller segments infinitely many times. However the idea of infinite divisibility is also not part of the Phenomenon, it exists purely in the world of Mathematical concepts.

A nice metaphor for Kant's ideas of Space-Time is the way in which we use Cartesian co-ordinates to represent objects in geometry. Clearly the co-ordinate system is not another object, but instead it is an abstraction used to organize the objects that exist in mathematical space. Morever the co-ordinate system is not unique, in the sense that we can choose some other system, such as Polar Co-ordinates if we think that it supplies a better representation.

Once we accept the idea that Space-Time is not part of the Noumenon, but instead are constructs created by our brains to organize sensory data, then the question arises, what exactly is in the Noumenon? To this Kant's response is: We don't know, and we van never know. If we were to exist in the Noumenon, then we would have the ability to operate outside the limitations of Space and Time. However all of our knowledge comes from operating within the limitations of time and space. Operating outside it would mean seeing everything simultaneously or knowing all time in an instant, which would obliterate the very connection between objects and instances that constitutes knowledge. Since an observation is always an observation in time and space, the Laws of Physics are all about operations in time and space. We may speculate about the world outside the conditions of time and space, but nontemporal and nonspatial perspectives obliterate the very idea of an observation, and hence are incompatible with any knowledge we can have of the world.

Kant also believed that we could presume the existence of an object in the Noumenon, operating in unified space-time whole, even if we cannot grasp it as an object using or senses. This allows us to derive universal, necessary and true statements in areas such as Religion and Ethics, a program that Kant carried out in his later works. In Science though we are limited to studying representations that come to us through our sense of space and time, not the underlying reality.  

Kant's ideas came before the discovery of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, and so a natural question id how well they have held up in light of these theories. The short answer is that that they have held up quite well.  Einstein himslf never reconciled to the idea that the models in Physics were not describing Base Reality, hence is oft quoted remark that "God does not play dice with the universe" when he was confronted by the indeterminism at the base of Quantum Theory. However Heisenberg was inspired by the idead of Kant in creating his Matrix Mechanics, which he did by coming up with equations that purely explain our oberservations of microscopic pehenomena, and did not to try to visualize what lies behind those equations. Indeed he later come up with the idea of the Uncertainity Principle that showed that our ideas of position and momentum do not extend to the microscopic world. Hence electrons and their ilk are not objects in the sense that we see around us, and it is impossible for us to visualize what they are, since they don't fal;l into any of the categories of objacts that we are familar with. This sounds a little bit like Kant's ideas of the Noumenon, since that too contains things that we can't visualize. However this is differene between the two, namely that the microscopic objects still exist within the framework of space-time and hence cannot be part of the Noumenon. But the very fact that Physics has come up with objects that exist in our Perceived Reality, but we are not able to visualize what they are or look like, lends credibility to Kant's ideas that there exist things that are beyond the reach of our perceptual senses.


## Mathematical Models of Reality vs Perception of Reality

(https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant1.jpg) 

Galileo and Newton made a monumental discovery more than 400 years ago, which is that Laws of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description. Taking Kant's lessons into account, this statement should be modified to state that the Laws of or Perception of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description. This adds another actor to our drama, namely the space of Mathematical Systems. 
What is a Mathematical System? These are systems that contain objects, that are defined soley by the way they interact with other objects. The interaction is in terms of mathematical operations (that differ from system to system). Mathematicians work consists of deriving interesting properties of the system using rules of logic. 
At one time it was thougt that Mathematical Systems are connected with our Perceived Reality, in the sense that the objects and rules in the system were abstractions of objects and rules in the the real world. However this prejudice  was exploded in the 19th century when mathematicians came up with geometries and number systems that has nothing to do with what we see around us, but were studied purely because they resulted in interesting mathematical results. Some of these systems later found applications in modeling Nature, much to the surprise of scientists. In this section we explore this aspect of our scientific knowledge which results in questions such as: Why does Nature seem to obey mathematical laws? What is the connection between the objects used in mathematical systems used to model nature, and the actual objects found in nature? Do mathematical models of nature represent reality, and if so is it the Phenomenon or the Noumenon?


## A Proposed Framework




## How to LLMs Fit Within the Framework?

- LLMs as a Mathematical Model for Human Cognition








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Kant's Theory of Knowledge and Kant's Antinomies
- Physical Models of the World
- LLMs and a Model for Language
- How would LLMs fit within Kant's framework
- Implications for AGI


## Kant's Theory of Knowledge

- Base reality (Neumenon)  is not the same as perceived reality (Phenomenon)
- Certain problems in perceived reality have no solution (cannot be resolved as either true or false), since they use concepts of space and time that do not exist in base reality (Kant’s antinomies)
- Base reality is not accessible through our senses

## Kant and Modern Physics

- Mathematical models of perceived reality (Physics) are not the same as perceived reality
- The deepest level of reality that physics posits is the quantum wave function.
- Is the wave function real? It is clearly not part of perceived reality, is it part of base reality, ie part of Kant’s Neumenon. 
- The QBism framework for quantum mechanics resolves the wave particle duality problem by stating that the wave function is not part of either perceived or base reality. It is a subjective measure of how likely an event might happen, and is tied to our perception.
- Cosmology: Are we justified in extrapolating our models of physics to speculate about the beginnings of the universe? No, these models only work so far as they model our perceived reality. There is no way to verify that they work at the beginnings of the universe since our perception does not extend that far. The extrapolation is just a mathematical exercise, not tied to perceived reality. 
- Are we accessing base reality through the mathematical models? No, since that cannot be accessed even using advanced instruments such as electron microscopes and powerful telescopes 
- In biology, the chemical model of the cell is not same as the actual cell. The chemical models do not capture what makes a cell living, they are extrinsic rather than intrinsic. 
- No danger that one day science will exhaust all that there is to know, since we can only get closer to the base reality, but never reach it. 
- There is some unknown factor that makes a cell alive, chemical models are nowhere close to discovering this.

## Artificial Neural Networks and LLMs

- The ANN is a model for human cognition
- Extending Kant’s thinking: The ANN can never be the same as cognition
- Mistaking ANNs for cognition can lead to antinomies
- But ANNs can approximate cognition
- Perceived Reality —> Language model of Perceived Reality —> LLM model of language 
- There is some unknown factor that makes the biological brain conscious, ANN models are not close to discovering this
- Can Integrated Information Theory ( IIT) be used as a measure of how close an ANN is to human cognition 

## LLMs within a Kantian Framework

Three latent spaces
1. latent space of perception of reality, either images or language or both together 
2. Latent space of reality is physics
3. Latent spaces of mathematics 
4. Our brain

- latent space of models of reality (physics) can be mapped on to a subset of the latent space of mathematics
- Our brain creates a mapping from perceptions to the latent space of perceptions . The points of this latent space are stored in the brain. 
- Mathematical latent  space is a creation of our brain

There are two latent spaces of reality
- Space 1 is a mapping in the brain to individual points of our perception of reality 
- Space 2 is a mathematical mapping, that is useful for doing predictions (physics). This is a mapping from our perception of reality to latent spaces of physics. 
- The mathematical space used in 2 is also a creation of the brain
- Hence physics does the following: 1) identify mathematical objects that can map to our perceptions of reality, such as fields, groups etc 2) Come up with mathematical equations that work on the mathematical objects and can be used for doing predictions (involving time and space)
- Are the regularities that we observe in nature a creation of the human brain? Then it makes sense that another human creation, ie mathematics, can be used to describe those regularities
- These regularities exist in time and space, and according to Kant, the these are a creation of the brain
