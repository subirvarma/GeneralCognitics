# What Would Kant Think of LLMs?

## Introduction

In the the late 1700s, the great German Phiolosopher Immanuel Kant, revolutionized his field through the work *Critique of Pure Reason*. This was probably the most significant advance in Philosophy since the time of the Greeks, and influenced the course of the subject in the subsequent two centuries. In parallel with developments in Philosophy, modern Science was also making great strides. It emerged in the 17th century with luminaries such as Galileo and Newton, but charted its own course idependent of Philosophy. This was due to the separation between the Science and Philosophy that was put into place by the great French thinker Descartes, at the dawn of the Scientific Age. The separation between Science and Philosophy finally started break down in the 20th century when it became clear that the new science of Quantum Mechanics had some deep problems if we try to interpret it within the existing Scientific Framework. Another field of study, namely that which deals with the human mind, also did not fit at all within this framework, leading to intractable issues such as the "Hard Problem of Consciousness". 

In our century we have another emerging science (or is Technology?) of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the attendent subfield of Large Language Models (LLMs). These serve as models for Human Language and there are open questions whether these models are actually modeling Human Cognition.
A deeper understanding of a proper framework for science has become even more urgent due to these developments.  Getting a better understanding of how mathematical models, whether in Physics or in Artificial Intelligence, relate to reality and our perceptions of reality is critical in resolving these questions. 
Fortunately there are several new ideas that scientists and philosophers have come up with in the last two decades and it seems that some of Kant's ideas, and especially his theory that the mind is responsible for creating our reality, are starting to become very relevant.  We have finally started to make some progress with  problems ranging from the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics to theories of how the mind works. In this essay I will start by surveying the state of knowledge in these fields, followed by some ideas on these can be applied to the interpretation of models for the mind in the form of ANNs.

Here is a brief definition of the main actors in this drama:

- Base Reality: This is sum total of what exists in the Universe.
- Our Perceived Reality: Information from Base Reality impinges on our senses, and our brain puts it all together (using a process that is largely mysterious), to create the world as we see, hear and feel it.
- Mathematics and Mathematical Models: Mathematics can be defined as a self-consistent system ofthought we have built, operating using the rules of logic. It can be used to create models of reality, as was discovered by Galileo and Newton more than 300 years ago.
- Human Cognition: Our brain consists of a large number of interconnected neurons, which are somehow able to create our Perceived Reality, and enables us to exist in it.
- Artificial Neural Networks: These are also Mathematical models, but of a special kind since they serve as models for the mind. These models are very different the classical Newtonian models that are used in Physics.

The rest of this essay is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss the Penrose framework for Scientific Knowledge, which proposes a relationship between Perceived Reality, Human Conition and Mathematical Models. Section 3 is on the relationship between Base Reality and Perceived Reality as discussed by Kant and others, Section 4 is on Mathematical Models of Reality and our current understanding of good these models are in describing it. We propose a modification to Penrose's framework in Section 5, and in Section 6 we add LLMs to the mix and discuss how it might fit within this modified framework.

## The Kantian Framework

Immanuel Kant set out for himself the task to discovering the limits of human knowledge and the result was his book "Critique of Pure Reason", that was published almost 250 years ago. In this he theorized that our perception of reality, which he called the Phenomenol World, is not the same as Base Reality, which he called the Noumenal World. Morever, it is not possible for us to gain access to the Noumenon, since all interactions with are mediated through our perceptual senses. Hence what we perceive is the world that our brain creates using the information from the Noumenon coming through our senses. However this information is very different than the world that we actually perceive, for example when we see a red object in front of us, the sensation of redness is not part of the light waves coming from that object.
Fundamental to our perception of the world are the concepts of Space (or the fact that objects have an extension in space) and Time (or the fact that events have a duration in time). Kant claimed that Space and Time are purely concepts created by our brain to bring order to the chaos of information coming to our senses, and do not exist in the Noumenon. Our perceptions are not things in the world, they are versions of those things that we construct in our minds by shaping them in space and time. Hence our image of reality is not the same as base reality, but is a creation of our brain, with the objective of helping us survive in the world.

Kant did not argue for the existence of the Noumenon using empirical experiments, but instead relied on rhetoric and phiolosopical arguments. His main arguments are known as Kant's Antinomies which are logical contradictions that arise when we confuse the phenomenal world and the noumenal world. Since the time of Kant the idea of the Noumenon has been much debated. Philosophers such as Hegel and Nietzsche have objected to the way Kant separated the world in two layers, and since the Noumenon layer is effectively unknowable, it is irrelevant to practical philosophy.

The book " The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant and the Ultimate Nature of Reality" has an excellent description of the main elements of Kant's philosophy, and also has a fascinating discussion of the similarities between that, the short stories of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges and basic ideas behind Quantum Maechanics as formulated by Werner Heisenberg. The following discussion of Kant's ideas borrows heavily from the presentation in this book:

For sensory input to become knowledge of the world requires that objects be located in respect to other things and that events be sequenced as coming before, afer or simultaneous to other events. But locating objects with respect to one another in space, or sequencing events in time, is something that pure sense perception on its own cannot accomplish. This exposure needs to be organized in order to experience it.
In order to experience the spatial relations between objects we implicitly assume that they exist together in a shared space. However space itself is not an object of experience, but the very condition for experiencing objects. Space (and time) are like representations that our brain creates so that we can experience reality.
Consciousness is another entity creates by our minds in order to create a timeline that unifies our experiences and orders our perceptions.

We make a fundamental error by assuming that Space and Time are objects in themselves that exist in Base Reality, just like other objects that we see around us. But instead Space and Time are created by our brains as a way to mediate between the chaotic amount of data that is constantly impinging on our senses, by organizing them within this space-time framework or representation. Several classical paradoxes, such as that of Zeno, arise because of our tendency to objectify Space-Time, followed by our application of the mathematical idea of infinite divisibility, to conclude that space-time can be divided into smaller and smaller segments infinitely many times. However the idea of infinite divisibility is also not part of the Phenomenon, it exists purely in the world of Mathematical concepts. The Laws of Physics are really the laws of our observations of how things behave in our Perceived Reality. There is a very nice quote by Heisenberg in this regard: "We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning".

A nice metaphor for Kant's ideas of Space-Time is the way in which we use Cartesian co-ordinates to represent objects in geometry. Clearly the co-ordinate system is not another object, but instead it is an abstraction used to organize the objects that exist in mathematical space. Morever the co-ordinate system is not unique, in the sense that we can choose some other system, such as Polar Co-ordinates if we think that it supplies a better representation.

Once we accept the idea that Space-Time is not part of the Noumenon, but instead are constructs created by our brains to organize sensory data, then the question arises, what exactly is in the Noumenon? To this Kant's response is: We don't know, and we can never know. If we were to exist in the Noumenon, then we would have the ability to operate outside the limitations of Space and Time. However all of our knowledge comes from operating within the limitations of time and space. Operating outside it would mean seeing everything simultaneously or knowing all time in an instant, which would obliterate the very connection between objects and instances that constitutes knowledge. Since an observation is always an observation in time and space, the Laws of Physics are all about operations in time and space. We may speculate about the world outside the conditions of time and space, but nontemporal and nonspatial perspectives obliterate the very idea of an observation, and hence are incompatible with any knowledge we can have of the world.

Kant also believed that we could presume the existence of an object in the Noumenon, operating in unified space-time whole, even if we cannot grasp it as an object using or senses. This allows us to derive universal, necessary and true statements in areas such as Religion and Ethics, a program that Kant carried out in his later works. In science though we are limited to studying representations that come to us through our sense of space and time, not the underlying reality.  Note that Kant did not deny the existence of an objective reality that exists out there. and is common to all of us. His main point was that this reality is not accessible to us since our mind creates a curtain between us and this reality. 

Kant's ideas came before the discovery of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, and so a natural question is how well they have held up in light of these theories. The short answer is that that they have held up quite well.  Einstein himslf never reconciled to the idea that the models in Physics were not describing Base Reality, hence is oft quoted remark that "God does not play dice with the universe" when he was confronted by the indeterminism at the base of Quantum Theory. 
However Heisenberg was inspired by the ideas of Kant in creating his Matrix Mechanics. His equations were derived with the objective of explaining observations of microscopic pehenomena, and did not to try to visualize a human comprehensible model that lies behind those equations. Indeed he later come up with the idea of the Uncertainity Principle that showed that our ideas of position and momentum do not extend to the microscopic world. Hence electrons and their ilk are not objects in the sense that we see around us, and it is impossible for us to visualize what they are, since they don't fall into any of the categories of objects that we are familar with. This sounds a little bit like Kant's ideas of the Noumenon, since that too contains things that we can't visualize. However this is difference between the two, namely that the microscopic objects still exist within the framework of space-time and their properties can be accessed using scientific instruments and hence cannot be part of the Noumenon. Hence they are still part of the Phenomemon, but these entities are so outside the realm of our daily experience that our language does not have the words to describe them.
But the very fact that Physics has come up with objects that exist in our Perceived Reality, but we are not able to visualize what they are or look like, lends credibility to Kant's ideas that there exist things that are beyond the reach of our perceptual senses.

The other domain of science that might shed light on the existence of the Noumenon is Cognitive Science, which is the study of how the neurons in our brain process information. There are numerous experiments that show that our color perception changes as a function of the type of lighting in the environment, also our perception of movement can be fooled by specially designed patterns. The study of perception in other animals also shows that there are creatures whose perception of the world is very different than ours. In general Cognitive Science does not present us with any irrefutable evidence for the existence of the Noumenon, but it does make it plausible to see how an interconnected network of billions of neurons might be able to create the world that we perceive.

Figure 1

Fig. 1 summarizes Kant's views: It shows signals such as light and sound waves coming from the Noumenon which impinge on our senses. These are then processed by the brain, which abstracts the deluge of data, and presents a picture of reality to us which is tailored so as to help us survive in our environment. Since all data coming from the Noumenon is filtered through the brain, we cannot get direct access to the Noumenon.

## Modern Science and Philosophy

Kant's ideas were developed about a hundred years after the start of modern science with Newton and Galileo. Science initially developed and made progress using a different framework than the one proposed by Kant, called Cartesian Dualism. This framework achieved great success and gave us the modern world. However as described later in the section, it has run into problems in recent times, which have led people to re-examine the basic ideas behind the framework.

Galileo and Newton made a monumental discovery more than 400 years ago, which is that the Laws of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description (taking Kant's lessons into account, this statement should be modified to state that the Laws of our Perception of Nature lend themselves to a mathematical description). This adds another actor to our drama, namely the space of Mathematical Systems. 

What is a Mathematical System? These are systems that contain numerical or geometric objects, that are defined solely by the way they interact with other objects. The interaction is in terms of mathematical operations (that differ from system to system). The work of mathematicians consists of deriving interesting properties of the system using the rules of logic. 
At one time it was thought that Mathematical Systems reflect our reality, in the sense that the objects and rules in the system were abstractions of objects and rules in the the real world. However this prejudice  was exploded in the 19th century when mathematicians came up with Non-Eucledian Geometries and Number Systems that have nothing to do with our reality, but were studied purely because they resulted in interesting mathematical results. Some of these systems later found applications in modeling nature, much to the surprise of scientists.

Figure 2

Our tale begins with Rene Descartes, the founder of Co-ordinate Geometry, which was one of his many achievements. Descartes also came up with the idea of Cartesian Dualism as the philosophical foundation for science, which is illustrated in Fig. 2. His big idea was to banish the mind from within the domain of science so that explanations for the mind and subjective sensations such as color and smell were placed outside the scope of science. Instead science was to limit itself to modeling the objective aspects of Nature, such as mass or momentum, which could be measured in a precise manner using instruments. 
Descartes was motivated by several objectives in making this proposal. One big motivation was probably to keep the mind outside the scientific purview and make it part of the religous world, which was probably wise given what had happened to Bruno and Galileo around the same time that Descartes lived. Another motivation was to accelerate the progress of science by limiting it things which could be measured in an objective fashion. Other aspects of this framework include:

- The Physical World exists independent of our minds, and what we perceive is a true reflection of it. The job of the scientist was to discover the eternal Laws of Nature which have existed from the beginning of time and are independent of whether humans existed or not.
- The Physical World can be modeled using mathematics. Galileo had a nice quote in this regard, "The Laws of Nature are written in the language of mathematics".

Descartes idea of duality was accepted by the Scientific Community, and for the next 300 years led to the massive progress in science and technology. Scientists thought that by discovering the mathematical Laws of Nature they were plumbing the depths of reality, so that indeed reality at its very core was a set of mathematical equations. 

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant13.png) 

Figure 3

The Cartesian Framework for science has undergone a few changes since the seventeenth century, especially later since it was later no longer taboo to include the mind as part of the framework. The generally accepted modern framework for science is well illustrated by the eminent physicist Roger Penrose as described in his book "The Road to Reality", and this is shown in Fig. 3. This framework (which we will refer to as the post-Cartesian framework) states that:

- Our mind creates the world of mathematical objects.  
- A subset of the world of mathematical objects serves as a model for the Physical World. A stronger version of this belief is that the Physical World at its core is nothing else but a set of mathematical equations (for example see the book "Our Mathematical Universe" by Max Tegmark).
- The Physical World has its own objective reality independent of the Mental World, and this is what we perceive. Our perception of the Physical World reflects a true picture of what exists in Nature.
- Our brain is one of the objects that exists in the Physical World. Since other aspects of the Physical World can be modeled using mathematics, it should be possible to come up with a model for the brain which would explain aspects of the mind such as consciousness.

The post-Cartesian framework was highly successful in discovering laws that govern the Physical World. After the the initial development of Newtonian Dynamics, other aspects of Nature such Electromagnetic Waves and the Laws of Thermodynamics were discovered in the 19th century, and they all followed this framework.
The first crack in the framework happened in the beginning years of the 20th century, with the discovery of energy quanta by Max Plack. Within a few years of that, Einstein proposed that light exhibits both wave and particle properties, and indeed within a couple of decades experiments were conducted that showed that material particles like electrons also have wavelike properties such wavelength. This raised a conundrum since for the first time the fundamental constituents of nature had a form that could not be visualized by us humans. Soon after this Heisenberg followed by Schrodinger proposed a mathematical description of microscopic phenomena that was unlike any theory that had come before. Schrodinger's version of the theory was based on a fundamental quantity called the Wave Function (or $\psi$) whose nature was completely mysterious. After a lot of debate, Max Born proposed that the square of the Wave Function gave the probability of the quantum system being in particular state, which meant that the dynamics of microscopic particles  was fundamentally random. 

In parallel several interpretations of Quantum Mechanics were proposed, the most prominent being what is called the Copenhagen Interpretation. This does not try to explain the wave-particle duality, but simply states that the particle can exhibit either depending upon the experiment being performed. A quantum particle that is not being observed can be in a superposition of several states at the same time, and does not settle into a definite state until it is observed. This leads to the paradox of Schrodinger's Cat being dead and alive at the same time (this has been tested experimentally with the Aspect experiments which resulted in the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics, not with a cat though :-)). The Copenhagen Interpretation also states that the wave function is an objective (i.e., observer independent) measure of the uncertainity that we have about the Quantum World, and this uncertainity vanishes for objects in the macro world, in other words Quantum Mechanics comes into effect for microscopic objects but is not relevant at normal scales. This last claim of the Copenhagen Interpretation has been experimentally shown to be false, so that even macro objects can exhibit wave particle duality.

The Copenhagen Interpretation is a way to shove the interpretive problems in Quantum Theory under the rug, and proceed with the day to day applications of the theory which work well. However one can think of experiments in which the Copenhagen Interpretation fails, and the most well known of these is known as the problem of Wigner's Friend, which is as follows: Assume that there is a closed box containing a quantum particle that can be in one of two states, and and an Observer 1 who is located out side the box. In addition the system containing the box and Observer 1 is itself in a larger box which is closed to the outside. There is also a second observer, say Observer 2 (Wigner's friend) who is located outside the larger box. Lets say Observer 1 at some point opens the box and finds that the partcle is in State 1, at this point the Wave Function from Observer 1's point of view has 'collapsed' since there is no more uncertainity about the state of the partcle. However Observer 2 does not know this, and from his point of view, the combined system consisting of the particle and Observer 1 can be one of several possible quantum states. From this experiment it follows that there is no single observer independent interpretation of the wave function, i.e., the wave function is an a subjective measure of uncertainity in a quantum system, and cannot be separated from the observer. This is precisely the Quantum Bayesianism or Qbism interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that was proposed recently. According to Qbism the wave function is a subjective measure of Quantum Uncertainity and exists only in the mind of the observer, and is not really part of nature as such. This strikes at the heart of the post-Cartesian Framework since we can no longer claim that science is discovering Laws of Nature that exist independent of our mind. A good description of these topics can be found in Chapter 5 of the book "Putting Ourselves Back in the Equation" by George Musser.

The other big problem with the post-Cartesian framework for science emerges when we try to use it to model the brain.
The framework actually opens up the possibility of modeling the mind using mathematical models since the framework says that the brain is part of the Physical Worldand all of the Physical World can be modeledusing mathematics, then what is the mathematicalmodel for the mind?  How can a set of physical processes happening within the brain give rise to our mind and its subjective experiences? And therein lies the great mystery: 
The mechanism by which the brain reflects the physical reality (that objectively exists out there according to this framework) in our minds, along with its subjective sensations, has no explanation within the post-Cartesian Framework, which is referred to as the "Hard Problem of Consciousness". 

In order to explain the mind, perhaps we need to go beyond the post-Cartesian Framework, just as Qbism did for Quantum Mechanics. In the next section we discuss in detail whether trhe Kantian Framework can solve the problems that are inherent in the post-Cartesian Framework.

## A Kantian Framework for Science

In the previous section we described how at a fundamental microsopic level, the equations of Physics don't describe an objective observer independent reality, but instead provide predictions that are tied to the mind of the observer donng the experiment. This appears very much like the picture of the world that Immanuel Kant drew in his philosophy. In this section we pursue this line of thinking, and also extend to see how the Kantian Framework also applies to models of the mind.

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant9.png) 

Figure 4

This Kantian view of Science is illustrated in Figure 4. There is no longer a split between the Physical World and the Mental World, all our perceptions of reality are a creation of our minds and hence are part of the Mental World. This Perceived Reality does not reflect the Base Reality or the "world as is", but is a creation of minds, and is done in a way so as to help us survive in the world.
There is indeed an Objective Reality, Kant's Noumenon, that exists beyond our perception, and the world that we see is derived from that. However the Mathematical Theories of Nature that we come up with are not describing the Noumenon, but are instead modeling the subjective perceptions created by our minds. This might also explain why mathematics is so effective in modeling Nature, this is because both mathematics and Nature (as we experience it) are creations of our minds. 
The Kantian framework saya the (perceived) reality is a creation of mind, and at the same time the mind is one of the objects that exists in reality. This circular path is ofen referred to as a "Strange Loop" in Cognitive Science.

Another as pect of the Kantian Framework is that Mathematical Models are always approximations and not a true picture of reality at the fundamental level. This is due to the fact these models are two levels removed from the Base Reality or the Noumenon. At the top level our minds create an abstraction of the Base Reality, and the Mathematical Models create a second level of abstraction since they are modeling the Perceived Reality which is itself an abstraction. This also means that Mathematical Models are only as good as the predictions that they make and we should not mistake the model for reality.

The Kantian Framework allows for creating mathematical models of the mind, since the mind is one of the objects that exists in our Perceived Reality. What will such a Model look like? In the next Section we take a stab at answering this question by looking at the emerging science of Artificial Neural Networks.

## Incorporating Models of the Mind into the Kantian Framework

In the previous section we described a Kantian Framework for science that takes into account the fact the mind is one of the objects that exists in our perceived reality, and hence we can try to model it using the tools of Mathematical Modeling, just as we have done for the other objects that exists in Perceived Reality. The mind is special case, since we use the mind  for creating perceived reality, and hence in a sense the mind is trying to model itself within the confines of the perceptual boundaries that it has created.

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant10.png) 

Figure 5

Fig. 5 is a modification to Fig. 4 in which I have separated out the mind from other objects in Perceived Reality in the interests of clarity. The assumption behind this figure is that mathematical models that have proven so successful in modeling the physical world, can also be used to model the mind. The mathematical models for the former take the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). But what kind of models can we use for the mind?

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/Kant11.png) 

Figure 6

Fig. 6 proposes that mathematical models for the mind take the form of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNS). These models are fundamentally different than PDEs and point to a radically different way for building models. Even though the PDE models for physical reality make use of advanced mathematics, at their root they are simple, in the sense that they are able to model complex physical phenomena using only a few equations with tens of parameters. It can be argued that the reason why this is even possible is because of the a priori structure that our minds create in order to organize the chaos of data coming from the Noumenon. According to Kant these structures include our perceptions of Space and Time, and these simplify models of (perceived) Physical Reality quite a bit, since these imply that all intercation between entities in the model is limited to those entities that are in the neigborhood of each other. Without this assumnption building mathematical models of Physical Reality would be impossible.
However we cannot make any such assumption in the case of models for the mind, and indeed Atrificial Neural Networks incorporate models for individual neurons that can potentially interact with all other neurons in the model, which makes these models extremely complex. We also need billions of parameters to model all these interactions, so these models are very different than the PDE models. 

Our minds come with some pre-existing (or a priori) structure when we are born (including the concepts of space and time according to Kant), which have been built up over hundreds of millions of years of evolution. But this is not the case for ANNs. Before training starts, the "mind" of the ANN can be considered to be a *Tabula Rasa" since all their neuronal connections are set to random values (strictly speaking we do endow the ANN with an pre-existing connection topology, so it is not entirely a *Tabula Rasa*). Which is why it takes so much a data to train the ANN, in some sense we are trying to reproduce the gradual process of natural evolution within a space of a dew days of training. During this time the ANN has to discover the structure of the world through the images and text that we feed into it.

In some sense the images and text in the Training Data can be considered the be the equivalent of the Nuomenon for ANNs. Just as our mind organizes the chaos of the actual Noumenon using structures as Space and Time, similarly ANNs must use some organizing principle to structure the chaos of data from their Training Sets. What are these organizing principles? Are they similar to the concept of Space and Time that emerge in our minds? We will discuss this question further in the following sections.

## How to LLMs Fit Within the Framework?

- LLMs as a Mathematical Model for Human Cognition








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Artificial Neural Networks and LLMs

- The ANN is a model for human cognition
- Extending Kant’s thinking: The ANN can never be the same as cognition
- Mistaking ANNs for cognition can lead to antinomies
- But ANNs can approximate cognition
- Perceived Reality —> Language model of Perceived Reality —> LLM model of language 
- There is some unknown factor that makes the biological brain conscious, ANN models are not close to discovering this
- Can Integrated Information Theory ( IIT) be used as a measure of how close an ANN is to human cognition 

## LLMs within a Kantian Framework

Three latent spaces
1. latent space of perception of reality, either images or language or both together 
2. Latent space of reality is physics
3. Latent spaces of mathematics 
4. Our brain

- latent space of models of reality (physics) can be mapped on to a subset of the latent space of mathematics
- Our brain creates a mapping from perceptions to the latent space of perceptions . The points of this latent space are stored in the brain. 
- Mathematical latent  space is a creation of our brain

There are two latent spaces of reality
- Space 1 is a mapping in the brain to individual points of our perception of reality 
- Space 2 is a mathematical mapping, that is useful for doing predictions (physics). This is a mapping from our perception of reality to latent spaces of physics. 
- The mathematical space used in 2 is also a creation of the brain
- Hence physics does the following: 1) identify mathematical objects that can map to our perceptions of reality, such as fields, groups etc 2) Come up with mathematical equations that work on the mathematical objects and can be used for doing predictions (involving time and space)
- Are the regularities that we observe in nature a creation of the human brain? Then it makes sense that another human creation, ie mathematics, can be used to describe those regularities
- These regularities exist in time and space, and according to Kant, the these are a creation of the brain
