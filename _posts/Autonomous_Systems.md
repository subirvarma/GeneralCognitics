# The Evolution of Agents: From Reinforcement Learning to LLM Agents

## Introduction

A few years ago the Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman published a book called *Thinking Fast and Slow*. This book was based on research that he had carried out
with his late collaborator Amos Tversky over the course of more than 30 years. These scientists discovered that there is an interesting structure in the way the human
brain works. Our thinking process can be neatly split into two parts: 

-  The first part, which they called System 1, is the part of our thinking that takes place outside our field of consciousness and happens automatically and quickly. All instances of perception and memory fall in this category, as does the type of thinking called intuitive. A typical example would be when we meet a person and are able to immediately tell whether it is someone we know. 
-  The second part called System 2 is the part of our thinking that we are conscious of, and requires an appreciable amount of mental effort to carry out. A typical example here would multiplying two numbers together.

## Reinforcement Learning Agents

- Training a dog

### Agents of Type 1: Neural Network Based

### Agents of Type 2: Algorithmic + Neural Networks

## LLM Based Agents

### The SayCAN Robot System with Inner Monologue

### Generative Agents with Memory and Planning
