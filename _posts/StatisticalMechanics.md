# Systems of Interacting Particles

Book Review: Critical Mass, How One Thing Leads to Another by Philip Ball

## Introduction

A couple of moinths ago when I was doing research for my post on Brownian Motion, I saw a reference to the book "Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another" by the science writer Phillip Ball. I finally got around to reading the book, and this post is the result. The book is over 650 pages and has a lot of material on the topic of Interacting Particle Systems. In this post I will attempt to summarize the parts that I found the most interesting, but I would encourage you to read the entire book, it is a fascinating topic.

So what are Interacting Particle Systems (or IPS)? As the name implies, these are systems consisting of multitudes of particles which influence each others behavior in some fashion. The IPS theory tries to connect the the macroscopic behavior of these systems with the rules that govern their interaction at the level of individual particles. An interesting aspect of the theory is that sometimes completely un-expected macroscopic behavior can result from the most benign micro interaction rules.
In some sense the theory of Interacting Partcle Systems is the opposite of the science of Brownian Motion that was discussed in the previous post. In this case we are not concerned with the behavior of individual particles, but with properties that are exhibited by the system as a whole.
An amazing number of phenomena can be modeled using IPS, both from the natural world as well those created by humans.
IPS systems can serve as abstract representations for several of these that are of practical interest, such as:

**Modesl for Groups of Atoms or Molecules**

All of matter can be considered to be an IPS, which individual particles being atoms or molecules. Phenomena such as phase transitions from liquid to a gas, or from a non-magnetic material to magnetic, fall within the range of topics that have been analysed using intarcting partcle models.

A very interesting application of the IPS theory has been to model structures that exist in our society. These include:

**Movement of Crowds**

The motion of crowds of people is an example of IPS. The theory can be used to predict what happens in a crowded room when everyone tries to exist at once, a painfully common occurrence which has led to loss of life.

**Models of Vehicular Traffic**

Moving vehicles on the road are another example of IPS. Phenomena such gridlock in rush hour traffic have been studied using the theory.

**Stock Market Trading**

Traders in a stock market are influenced by the trading decisions of other traders, and thus can be considered to be a type of IPS. A lot of times stock market fluctuations are caused not by fundamental factors such economic news, but solely as a result of how these interactions influence trading decisions, and this can cause large variations in the stock market.

**Racial Segregation in Urban Areas**

IPS has been used to model the phenomenon of racial segregation in cities, with the home buying habits of individuals serving as the IPS interactions. An eye-opening result of this analysis is that individual may be fairly tolerant of other races, but even small differences in their buying decisions can result in segregated neighborhoods.

**Alliances between Countries**

There is a very interesting IPS model that was used to capture the shifting alliances between countries that preceded the First World War. It was able to accurately predict the members of the two alliances that existed at the time war broke out.

**Alliances between Companies**

Business entities such as companies, which interact with one another according to the forces of co-operation and competition. Just like political alliances between countries, companies often form competing consortiums, and these can be analyzed using the tools of IPS.

**Models for Culture**

In Multi-ethnic countries such as the US there are competing cultures, and it is interesting to analyze the process whereby a single culture can come to dominate over all the others, and IPS can help in this regard.

**Models for the Macro-Economy**

Can the macro economy be modeled as an IPS? This has also been tried and resulted in an IPS model called Sugarscape.

**Scale Free Interactions**

The core behavior that causes IPS, is of course the fact that entitities don't act independently, but in fact their behavior is influenced by other entities in the environment they inhabit. Some of these interactions are local, i.e., with neighboring entities, but there are models that feature what are known as scale free interactions. As the name imnplies, these interactions can be global in scale, i.e., any entity can potentially interact with any of the other entities in the model. These interactions increasingly characterize the modern world due to the spread of Internet and Social Media as well as broadcast media such as TV News. IPS involving Scale Free interactions have a characteristic signature: Quantities of interest in these models obey the so-called Power Law in the way their probability distributions behave. These are also referred to as Zipf distributions, and are characterized by a "winner take all" effect, where a few of the entities dominate their ecosystems. Examples include the number of Social Media conenctions that one might have, the number of web pages that have links to a particular page etc. Often the connections in these systems exhibit something called the Small Network topology. These are characterized by the fact that most conenctions are local resulting in clusters in the graph model, but there are also connections between clusters, which reduces the overall path between any two nodes.

Phillip Ball's book was published over twenty years ago and preceded the current interest in Neural Networks. These can be considered to be a type of IPS in which the interaction between nodes is not given in advance, but is instead chosen so that the network optimizes a "Loss Function" defined over all the connections. This function is chosen so that the system performs some function that is useful to us, such as prediction or classification. Indeed some of the early Neural Networks designed by Geoffrey Hinton's group carry the name of Boltzmann, who was one of the originators of theory os Statistical Mechanics.

The dominant paradigm for space-time today models it as a continuum which can be described using partial differential equations. This theory suffers from the problem that it is not able to unify the force of Gravity with the other forces in nature. There have been attempts to arrice at a more fundamental theory that models space-time as an IPS, i.e., it is not a continuous quantity but instead consists of discrete nodes that interact locally with other nodes. We will briefly talk about thes toeards the end of this post.

## Space Time as Interacting Particle Systems

- Discrete models for Space-Time

Summary:
- Start by talking about city segregation statistics in the US. Racism has gone down in the US since the 1960s, especially in metropolitan areas. The what accounts for the segregation that we see in cities?
- Talk about stock market fluctuations. Can these be caused by trading patterns rather than market fundamentals?
- Is there a science that connects macroscopic behavior to microscopis rules of interacton between individual entities?
- Beginnings of such a science: Maxwell's kinetic theory of gasses. Assumes that particles move independently, leads to Gaussian distribution. This did not explain phase transitions.
- Van der Waals theory of phase transitions. He introduced rules for interaction between particles.
- Other systems that also exhibit phase transitions: Magnetic materials, the Ising model, crowd motion,
- Traffic models, the concept of metastability
- Ch 8 on stock market models can be omitted, it does not really talk about individual interactions
- How trading patterns can cause market volatility
- The Power Law and Self Organized Criticality (SoC), non-equilibrieum models. Natural Systems that obey this law: Eartquakes, forest fires, volcanic activity
- Power Law in human systems (Zipf)
- Model for Firms, power laws for sizes of firms, how individual behavior can be used to explain rise and fall of firms
- Models for alliances, corporate and political, Axelrod model
- Schelling model, p389. How macrobehavior cannot be predicted from individual behavior, racial segregation
