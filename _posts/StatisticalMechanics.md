# From Statistical Mechanics to Neural Networks

Physics of IPS
- [ ] Can macro properties be derived micro behavior of particles?
- [ ] Main macro properties: Energy, Entropy, Temperature, Pressure, The nature of heat.  What is it, why does it flow from hot to cold bodies? Phase transitions.
- [ ] Heat is due to the motion of particles at the micro level. Define S,E in terms of particles, T as a function of S and E. Show that resulting system behaves as expected at macro level.
- [ ] Micro canonical system: systems with fixed E and T
- [ ] Canonical systems: systems with fixed T but varying E
- [ ] Simplest case: No interactions
- [ ] Boltzmann theory: derivation of equilibrium quantities
- [ ] Equilibrium as the solution to Entropy Maximization problem?
- [ ] Addition of interactions
- [ ] Phase transitions as a result of interactions 
- [ ] Ising models  for magnetism

From Susskind 
- [ ] Temperature, energy and entropy definition
- [ ] The Boltzmann distribution from maximum entropy principle
- [ ] The Z function
- [ ] Formula for energy, entropy etc from Boltzmann distribution 
- [ ] The Ising model, analysis using the Z function and mean field approximation 
- [ ] Equilibrium energy levels in Ising model 
- [ ] Phase transitions by varying temperature in the Ising model

Spin glasses
- [ ] When system can exist in multiple equilibra at the same time

Spin Glasses and neural networks
- [ ] Hopfield model, relation to spin glasses
- [ ] Boltzmann Machines
- [ ] Phase transitions in the Hopfield model, leading to diffusion model
- [ ] Modern neural networks. The effect of the residual connection on the energy landscape.
