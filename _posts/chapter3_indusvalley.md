# D D Kosambi and His History of Ancient India: The Mysteries of the IVC

![](https://subirvarma.github.io/GeneralCognitics/images/fig8.jpg) 

A few years ago I came across the name D D Kosambi in a book on Indian History that I was reading at that time. The writer mentioned Kosambi's un-orthodox methods of researching Ancient Indian History, by going out into the rural contryside outside Pune, the town where he lived, and talking with the villagers. Intrigued, I ordered his book *The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India*, and it turned out to be one one of the finest books on this subject that I had come across. It covered the History of India from pre-historic times to about the beginning of the Christian Era and was full of penetrating insights on Indian History that I hadn't seen anywhere else. In this blog post I want to focus Kosambi's exposition on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) which forms Chapter 3 in his book. This book was written in the 1950s, and since then some of the mysteries of this civilization that Kosambi talked about have been answered with new archeological evidence. But the greater impact has come from the new gene sequencing technology that has become available in the last ten years. In October of 2019, a team of researchers published the paper [An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-86741930967-5.pdf), it was a follow-on to an earlier paper by the same group [The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central Asia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/) that was published a month earlier. These papers shed new light on the genetic background of the people who lived in the IVC and their connection to the modern Indian population. They showed that the current population of India has inherited about 50%-60% of its genetic makeup from the people of the IVC, with the remainder coming from a mixture of Indo-European tribes and the original tribal inhabitants of the subcontinent. Hence in a very real sense we Indians are all the children of the IVC. This sparked my interest in finding out more about this mysterious civilization and its origins in the remote past.

Kosambi proposed a number of theories about the IVC based on data that he had, and I will attempt to find out how these theories have fared in light of the new evidence. Before I launch into history, a few words on Kosambi, the man himself. I was surprised to learn that by profession Kosambi was a mathematician. In fact he made a notable contribution to the field of Stochastic Processes, and there is a result to his name called the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve Expansion. I knew this result from my graduate student days as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, it was used extensively in a Estimation and Detection Theory, which is a part of Digital Communications theory. Kosambi discovered this result a few years before Karhunen and Loeve, and more modern citations are increasingly including his name. Kosambi also contributed to the field of Numismatics, which is the study of ancient coins. Since Ancient Indians were not very particular about recording their history, the only information that we have about large stretches of Indian History are the coins from those periods. By applying modern statistical methods Kosambi was able to garner a lot of information from these coins, and his book abounds with these insights. Kosambi's interest in Ancient History was a side effect of his Numismatics work, and took most of his time in the later years of his life.

The transition from tribal hunter-gatherer stage to agricultural urban societies wasa pivotal one in human history. Until a hundred years ago, we knew of three civilizations from the 3rd millenium BCE that had done so, the Egyptian, the Sumerian and the Chinese, all located along river valleys. The IVC is te newest addition to this group and was un-known till about a hundred years ago.
The map above shows the maximum geographical extent of the IVC, which was quite extensive, much larger than the sister civilizations of Egypt and Sumer that existed at that time. It was mostly located along the valley of the Indus River and its tributaries, though it extended as far down as coastal Gujarat and even Maharashtra to the South. At that time peninsular and eastern India was covered with a dense jungle which could not be cleared using the bronze implements that the IVC had, which constrained their expansion into the Gangetic plane. 

The IVC existed in the time period 3300 BCE to 1700 BCE, with the period 2700-1900 BCE defined as the Mature Phase of the civilization. During this phase the IVC cities took on a standard appearance, with a common script. Their script has not been deciphered unfortunately, so we don't even know what they called themselves, though Sumerian documents refer to the country of *Meluhha* in the East with whom they had trade relations, which could very well be their name. All mention of Meluhha came to an end after 1750 BCE which coincides with the date at which the IVC came to an end.
Incidentally it is thought that the Sanskrit *Mlecha*, which refers to an outcast was probably derived from *Meluhha*. Indeed when I was growing up in a small town in Northen Bihar, I remember my mother using the term *Mlech* when she was particularly upset with one of the servants at our home. According to Kosambi, the main non-Aryan people named in the *Rigveda* were the Panis. He theorised that Sanskrit *vanik* comes from Pani, and this later became the modern *bania*. Other clues include the fact that coin is *pana* in Sanskrit, and trades, good and commodities are known as *panya*. This points to the possibility that trading and business people in later times were descended from the IVC.

The IVC was defined by their cities which featured advanced urban planning not seen anywhere else in the world at that time, and in stark contrast to more modern Indian cities (or for that matter in the West). These included wide boulevards laid down in a grid pattern with brick houses neatly arranged along the sides. Each house had a bathroom and so there were channels for supplying water to them and carrying away waste water. The bricks used for construction were of the sturdy kiln-fired type, with dimensionbs that are still used in India today.
Moreover their larger cities such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa had similar urban layouts, so it seems they applied the same master-plan in several places. There were some homes that were larger than others, which would qualify as palaces if they were in Knossos for example. But by and large every home had the basic amenities, which pointed to a highly egalitarian society. The sister civilizations that existed at the that time, namely the Sumerian and Egyptian, in contrast had a rigid hierarchy with the rulers living in splendid luxury in large palaces. It was though that such a hierarchy was necessary for a civilization to progress from the tribal stage to settled urban cities, but the IVC does not conform to this pattern. There is no evidence of a king, nobility or even organized religion in the remains of the IVC.

The people of the IVC practiced agriculture and grew several cereal crops. It is thought that they discovered agriculture independently of the so called Anatolian farmers in the Golden Crescent area of the Middle East and the Chinese, since there is no genetic evidence of the movement of people from either of these regions into the Indus Valley. Their diet would be familiar to the people of modern India and even featured spices such as turmeric. Their fields were watered by the waters of the rivers in the area, and they took advantage of the silt that was deposited in the annual flooding to fertilize the soil. However unlike the Sumerians they did not build a canal system for irrigation, instead they relied on crude dams to store water from the rivers.

IVC was a merchant civilization and they had extensive trade link with other civilizations from that time, especially with the Sumerians. The exports from the IVC included luxury items such as peacocks, ivory and ivory articles such as combs, apes, pearls, bead necklaces and cotton textiles.
Seals from the IVC have been found in the Sumerian capital of Ur, on the island of Bahrain and even on the coast of Africa. Kosambi thought that these trade links were by sea, so that the IVC had mastered ocean navigation to other ports along the Arabian Sea. As evidence he pointed to some IVC seals that have pictures of boats. His theory was that navigation was done by staying close to the shore at all times, and also by using releasing a crow to figure out the direction leading to land (this technique was mentioned in one of the *Jataka* tales).

### Origins of the IVC

One of the biggest mysteries about the IVC is their origin and their subsequent dissapearance after their civilization collapsed. Based on the information available during Kosambi's time, it seemed as though the sophisticated IVC cities appeared suddenly towards the beginning of the 3rd millenium BCE and were as mysteriosly abandoned a thousand years later.  There was almost no trace of the IVC in the written or oral records of the subsequent history of India, such as in the Vedas that were compiled around 1000 BCE.

Kosambi speculated that the unformity of the city designs showed that they were setup according to existing plans that were developed elsewhere and then bought in a finished state to the Indus Plains. He also made the very astute observation that perhaps the progenitors of the IVC lived in a rocky and hilly area when they were hunter-gatherers and once they developed agriculture and the basics of their urban civilization, they moved to flat the river plane that was more amenable to large scale farming. This conjecture may have been borne out with the discovery of the ruins of Mehrgarh in Balochistan which was excavated starting in 1974. In a hilly area at the edge of the Indus plain archaelogists discovered what looked like the progenitors to the IVC, with remains of an older hunter-gatherer stage followed by a farming community. Mergarh was occupied during the period 7000 BCE to 2000 BCE and there were similarities to the IVC in the artifacts discovered there. Archeologists have also discovered older smaller urban settlements in the deeper layers of the ruins of most of the larger IVC cities such as Harappa, which shows the cities evolved over time. However by 2700 BCE they seem to have settled on a final urban design that was closely replicated in all their cities, and there was very little change from then on. The city of Mohenjo-Daro seemes to have been founded after their urban design had solidified, so that no deeper layers have been discovered so far.

The other clue the origins of the IVC came from genetic sequencing data and is shown in the figure. The figure shows that people of the IVC had genes from two sources:

  -  Ancient hunter-gatherers who were related to the hunter-gatherers living on the Iranian plateau. As the figure shows the ancestors of the IVC split from the Iranian branch sometime before 10,000 BCE, well before the development of agriculture. Both these groups migrated to their final locations from an area whose location is now lost.
  -  Andamanese hunter-gatherers who represent the gene flow from the tribals of the Indian peninsula. These people came to India in one of the early human waves out of Africa around 50,000 BCE.

Thus the genetic evidence shows that the IVC population was not related to any other population that existed in the ancient world at that time, and may have lived in that area of North Western India since 10,000 BCE or even earlier.

### What did the People of the IVC look like?

### How Were the Cities Governed?

The ruins of the IVC have left us with almost no information about how the cities were governed or who the rulers were. Other civilizations have left written records about their kings, and it is also easy to identify their palaces among the ruins. The uniformity of the all the IVC cities scattered over such a wide area, and the fact that artifacts such as seals were identical everywhere, shows that there must have been some kind of central authority. 

The transition from hunter-gatherer stage to farming requires a ruling authority to co-ordinate the agricultural activities and distribute the surplus (to the non-farming part of the population), maintain irrigation infrastructure, defend the settlement from external invaders also also to provide internal policing in the cities. Such an authority sustains itself by taxing its subjects which pays for its activities. Clearly such an authority existed in the IVC as well, but its nature was very different than those in Egypt or Sumer. The archeological data shows no signs of war between the IVC cities, and none of the recovered artifacts include robust weapons that could be used for this purpose. From this Kosambi surmises that *whatever authority controlled the people did so without much force*.
Hence perhaps there was no warrior class in the IVC, but the cities were governed either by the merchant class or the religious authorities. There was another clue: He observed that there was a curious lack of change in the IVC cities for the last 500-600 years of their existence which is unlike any other civilization from that time. As he puts it:

*The pottery, the tool ttypes and the seals remained the same. The alphabet also was static, this was in strong contrast to India in the later historical period, where the forms of the letters varied so much from one century to the next that the script offers a fairly good method - sometimes the only know method - or dating manuscripts or incriptions*

Moreover even though IVC merchants were in regular contact with Mesopatamia, the IVC did not adopt any of the more advanced technoly or practices that the Mesopatomains had: Such as writing on clay tablets, canal irrigation or deep ploughing for agriculture. From this Kosambi concludes that the land as a whole was not owned by the merchant class hence they did not have any interest in agricultural improvements of the type seen in Mesopotamia. It follows that religious authorities in the IVC were in charge of the food supply and owned all the land. Kosambi further opined that like all ancient priesthoods, they prevented all innovation, which accounts for the stasis. Hence

*Religion, not prowress or violence, was the essential ideological force of the Indus society*

I think there is alot of truth to what Kosambi says, since this pattern occurs later in Indian history as well: *Religious stagnation folllowed with violent period of war*.

### How did the IVC come to an end

 Historians speculate that climate change may have been responsible with two of the seven rivers drying up. There are signs of a sudden end in Mohenjo-Daro. Genetic evidence points to conquest by the invading Indo-Europeans (Y chromosome vs Mitochondrial DNA data). 

### Continuation of the IVC culture in later history of India

- Temple design with sacred pools
- Gods who may have originated in the IVC: Shiva, Krishna
- Systems of weights and measures
- Fondness for jewelwry, bead making, bangles
- Brick sizes
