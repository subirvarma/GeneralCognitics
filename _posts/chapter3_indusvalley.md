## A Summary of Kosambi's Life

A few years ago I came across the name D D Kosambi in a book on Indian History that I was reading at that time. The writer mentioned Kosambi's un-orthodox methods of researching Ancient Indian History, by going out into the rural contryside outside Pune, the town where he lived, and talking with the villagers. Intrigued, I ordered his book *The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India*, and it turned out to be one one of the finest books on this subject that I had come across. It covered the History of India from pre-historic times to about the beginning of the Christian Era. and was full of penetrating insights on Indian History that I hadn't seen anywhere else. In this blog post I want to focus Kosambi's exposition on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) which forms Chapter 3 in his book. This book was written in the 1950s, and since then some of the mysteries of this civilization have been answered with new archeological evidence. But the greater impact has come from the new gene sequencing technology that has become available in the last ten years. In October of 2019, a team of researchers published the paper [An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-86741930967-5.pdf), it was a follow-on to an earlier paper by the same group [The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central Asia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/) that was published in September, 2019. These papers shed new light on the genetic background of the people who lived in the IVC and their connection to the modern Indian population. Kosambi proposed a number of theories about the IVC based on data that he had, and I will attempt to find out how these theories have fared in light of the new evidence.

Before I launch into history, a few words on Kosambi, the man himself. I was surprised to find out that by profession Kosambi was a mathematician. In fact he made a notable contribution to the field of Stochastic Processes, and there is a result to his name called the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve Expansion. I knew this result from my graduate student days as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, it was used extensively in a Estimation and Detection Theory, which is a part of Digital Communications theory. Kosambi discovered this result a few years before Karhunen and Loeve, and more modern citations are increasingly including his name. Kosambi also contributed to the field of Numismatics, which is the study of ancient coins. Since Ancient Indians were not very particular about recording their history, the only information that we have about large stretches of Indian History are the coins from those periods. By applying modern statistical methods Kosambi was able to garner a lot of information from these coins, and his book abounds in these. Kosambi's interest in Ancient History was a side effect of his Numismatics work, and took most of his time in the later years of his life. 


## Kosambi on the IVC

IVC Mysteries

- Who were these people
- How did the IVC come into existence
- Why was the IVC so static
- How was the IVC governed: How did they make the transition from tribal to urban civilization
- How did the IVC come to an end
- What happened to the IVC people after their civilization ended

### Who were the people of the IVC and where did they come from?

During Kosambi's time, one of the biggest mysteries about the IVC was their origin and their subsequent dissapearance after their civilization collapsed.
