# D D Kosambi and His History of Ancient India: The Mysteries of the IVC

## A Summary of Kosambi's Life

A few years ago I came across the name D D Kosambi in a book on Indian History that I was reading at that time. The writer mentioned Kosambi's un-orthodox methods of researching Ancient Indian History, by going out into the rural contryside outside Pune, the town where he lived, and talking with the villagers. Intrigued, I ordered his book *The Culture and Civilization of Ancient India*, and it turned out to be one one of the finest books on this subject that I had come across. It covered the History of India from pre-historic times to about the beginning of the Christian Era and was full of penetrating insights on Indian History that I hadn't seen anywhere else. In this blog post I want to focus Kosambi's exposition on the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) which forms Chapter 3 in his book. This book was written in the 1950s, and since then some of the mysteries of this civilization that Kosambi talked about have been answered with new archeological evidence. But the greater impact has come from the new gene sequencing technology that has become available in the last ten years. In October of 2019, a team of researchers published the paper [An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-86741930967-5.pdf), it was a follow-on to an earlier paper by the same group [The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central Asia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/) that was published in September, 2019. These papers shed new light on the genetic background of the people who lived in the IVC and their connection to the modern Indian population. 

Kosambi proposed a number of theories about the IVC based on data that he had, and I will attempt to find out how these theories have fared in light of the new evidence. Before I launch into history, a few words on Kosambi, the man himself. I was surprised to find out that by profession Kosambi was a mathematician. In fact he made a notable contribution to the field of Stochastic Processes, and there is a result to his name called the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve Expansion. I knew this result from my graduate student days as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, it was used extensively in a Estimation and Detection Theory, which is a part of Digital Communications theory. Kosambi discovered this result a few years before Karhunen and Loeve, and more modern citations are increasingly including his name. Kosambi also contributed to the field of Numismatics, which is the study of ancient coins. Since Ancient Indians were not very particular about recording their history, the only information that we have about large stretches of Indian History are the coins from those periods. By applying modern statistical methods Kosambi was able to garner a lot of information from these coins, and his book abounds with these insights. Kosambi's interest in Ancient History was a side effect of his Numismatics work, and took most of his time in the later years of his life. 


## Kosambi on the IVC

IVC Mysteries

- Who were these people
- How did the IVC come into existence
- Why was the IVC so static
- How was the IVC governed: How did they make the transition from tribal to urban civilization
- How did the IVC come to an end
- What happened to the IVC people after their civilization ended

### Who were the people of the IVC and where did they come from?

The IVC was defined by their cities which featured advanced urban planning not seen anywhere else in the world at that time, and matched only last few hundred years. These featured wide boulevards laid down in a grid pattern with brick houses neatly arranged along the sides. Each house had a bathroom and so there were channels for supplying water to them and carrying away waste water. Moreover their larger cities such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa had similar urban layouts, so it seems they applied the same master-plan in several places. There were some homes that were larger than others, which would qualify as palaces if they were in Knossos for example. But by and large every home had the basic amenities, which pointed to a highly egaleterian society. The sister civilizations that existed at the that time, namely the Sumerian and Egyptian, in contrast had a rigid hierarch with the rulers living in splendid luxury in large palaces. It was though that such a hierarch was necessary for civilizationto progress from the tribal stage to settled urban cities, but the IVC does not conform to this pattern.

The people of the IVC practices agriculture and grew several cereal crops. Their diet would be familiar to the people of modern India and even features spices such as turmeric. Their fields were watered by the waters of the rivers in the area, and they took advantage of the silt that was deposited in the annual flooding to fertilize the soil. However unlike the Sumerians they did not have a canal system.

They had extensive trade link swith other civilizations from that time, especially with the Sumerians. Seals from the IVC have been found in Ur and on the island of Bahrain.

Their script has not been deciphered

In contrast to the Sumerians and the Egyptians, What they did not have: No prominent palaces or temples

During Kosambi's time, one of the biggest mysteries about the IVC was their origin and their subsequent dissapearance after their civilization collapsed. Based on the information available at the time, it seemed as though the sophisticated IVC cities appeared suddenly towards the end of the 3rd millenium BCE and as mysteriosly dissapeared around 1700 BCE.  They left no trace in the records of the subsequent history of India, such as in the Vedas that were compiled around 1000 BCE.

Kosambi speculated that the unformity of the city designs showed that they were setup according to an existing designs that were developed elsewhere, perhaps in a mountaneous area that was less hospitable to farming. This conjecture may have been borne with the discovery of the ruins of Mehrgarh in Balochistan.

Speculation that the society was ruled by religous leaders, no weapons found, they may have controlled the food system

Why IVC did not incorporate more advanced ideas from Sumer? Beacuse the religous authorities did not allow it, and the merchants did not find it profitable.

Who were the people? Genetic evidence shows that the polulation was not related to any other population that existed in the ancient world at that time, and may have lived in that area of North Western India since 10,000 BCE or even earlier.

What happened to them? Their descendents constitute the major part of the genetic make-up of modern day Indians, with most Indians having 50% of their gened from the IVC. 

How did the civilization end? Historians speculate that climate change may have been responsible with two of the seven rivers drying up. There are signs of a sudden end in Mohenjo-Daro. Genetic evidence points to conquest by the invading Indo-Europeans (Y chromosome vs Mitochondrial DNA data). 

Continuation of the IVC culture in later history of India:
- Temple design with sacred pools
- Gods who may have originated in the IVC: Shiva, Krishna
- Systems of weights and measures
- Fondness for jewelwry, bead making, bangles
- Brick sizes
