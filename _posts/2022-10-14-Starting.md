I am going start off my blog with a few posts on subjects that I have already written about, starting with topics in Deep Learning. Admittedly there were not 
originally written as blog posts but as chapters in my [online book on this subject](https://srdas.github.io/DLBook2/), but I thought this would be a good way 
to kick off the blog and test out the features that the github blogging platform supports.
