# Taming Randomness: The Story of Brownian Motion


## Introduction

At the dawn of the 20th century, there were two new sciences that were launched. One of them of course, was Quantum Mechanics, that came into existence with Max Planck's 1901 paper on Black Body Radiation. The other less well known one, was the science of Random Processes, and this was launched in a PhD Thesis by the French mathematician Bachelier, also around the same time. Quantum Mechanics of course went on the upend our ideas of Physics and reality in general, but what about Bachelier's discovery? This article is on precisely this topic.

The science of random events, or Probability Theory, was founded in the 17th century by Blaise Pascal. This was further developed in the 18th century, with the names most associated with it being Jacob Bernoulli and Alexandre De Moivre. Most of this work had to do with the development of the theory of random events and variables, such as the probabilities encountered in tossing of a coin or a 6-sided dice. But what if we were to look at an infinite sequence of coin or dice tosses, this then becomes a (discrete valued) Random Process. Extending this further, what if the random quantity evolves continuously in time? This is a continuous time Random Process, and the analysis of this is exponentialy harder than the discrete time version. Consequently very little progress had been made in this area and part of the reason was that there was no connection made between Probability Theory and the rapidly developing methods in analysis that resulted in developments such as the Borel Measure and the Lebesgue Integral towards the end of the 19th century.

The major contribution that the 20th century made to the science of randomness, is precisely this connection, and it all started with Bachelier's work from 1900. Why was this important? It laid the science of Random Processes on a firm mathematical foundation, by connecting it with the rest of mathematical analysis. This process atarted with Bachelier, and was completed two decades later with Andrei Kolmogorov's axiomization of Prabability Theory (this has an interesting echo with Quantum Mechanics that also took about two decades two mature from Planck to Heisenberg and Schrodinger). This made it possible to talk about quantities that evolve randomly and continuously in time, which is precisely what a Random Process is. 

Kiyosi Ito was a Japanese mathematician who made the next important advance in the theory of Brownian Motion. Working in wartime Tokyo during the 1940s, he came up with the idea of extending the idea of integration to the case when the integrand is Brownian Motion, and this is now called the Ito Integral in his honor. This idea was very influential in many practical applications since it allowed the analysis of functions of the Brownian Motion. This resulted in the extension of Random Process models beyond Brownian Motion, thus initiating the study of general Random Diffusion Proceses.

But how important are these Random Processes? Well, the most famous example of a randomly evolving continuous time process is the stock market, and this is precisely what Bachelier studied in his 1900 paper. His work was essentially lost until the 1950s, when it came to the attention of the  eminent economist Paul Samuelson, who built on Ito's work and applied it to create a model for the Stock Market called the Logarithmic Brownian Motion.
Later in the 1960s Black and Scholes extended Samuelson's work to create a model for options trading. This resulted in a Partial Differential Equation named after them, whose solution is probably the most important mathematical result in use in Wall Street today. In fact I recently came acrosss a list of the most imprtant equations in science, and the Black-Scholes equation was listed along with others such as Maxwell Equations for electromagnetism and Schrodinger's Equation for the wave function.

- [ ] What is the most random thing possible?
- [ ] The drunkards walk
- [ ] Limiting case of the drunkards walk, becomes something that captures the essence of randomness in a form that is amenable to analysis ie the BM

## The Weiner Process

- [ ] Introduce RVs
- [ ] Introduce random vectors and then discrete time random process
- [ ] Talk about law of large numbers
- [ ] Go on to continuous time random process
- [ ] Can we take an infinite sequence of random processes and scale them?
- [ ] Yes we can, and the result is the Weiner Process: Donsker's Theorem

## Adding Randomness to Models

- [ ] Why is it important? A convenient way to add randomness to a model. WP is analytically tractable. 
- [ ] Applications: Stock Market, image generation, noise filtering
- [ ] Processes that can be modeled as signal plus noise
- [ ] Great interest in extracting the signal, the filtering problem, Kalman Filtering
- [ ] Processes that can be modeled as a function of a Random Process
- [ ] Example: Financial Derivatives
- [ ] Modeling the space of Latent Variables
- [ ] Example: Diffusion based Image Generation

## Stochastic Calculus

- [ ] Go through the signal + noise model, as per page 15 of Oksendal's book. How this naturally leads to the Ito Integral.
- [ ] dx/dt = Ax + B dW/dt equivalent to x = int(Ax dt) + int(B dW).  The latter is the Ito integral. 
- [ ] Rough derivation of the existence proof of the Ito Integral

### Functions of the Weiner Process and the Ito Formula

- [ ] Why is this important? Because we want to build models for random phenomena, and a convenient way to do this is by expressing them as functionals of the Weiner process. Y_t=f(W_t).
- [ ] How do we get an expression for Y_t?
- [ ] By using the Ito formula. This involves evaluating a stochastic integral. 
- [ ] Diffusion Processes and Stochastic differential equations 
- [ ] Start with Weiner process to Brownian motion to Ito diffusion to Ito process
- [ ] Some important functions: Langevin equation, exponential Ito Process

- [ ] Is there a signal or is it all noise
- [ ] Theory 1: it is all noise, the EMH
- [ ] Hedge funds: we beg to disagree. Look up book on finance by Korean economist. Test to check if market is a BM, Andrew Lo book.
- [ ] How to extract the signal 
- [ ] Temporary trends, non stationary processes 
- [ ] Stock market model, geometric WP, Samuelson. 
- [ ] Trading using WP
- [ ] The Black Scholes stochastic PDE  for options pricing
- [ ] Is it possible to find regularities in the randomness? Using deep learning to do prediction.

## Image Generation using the Langevin Process

- [ ] Take an image and add noise to it, until it becomes completely random 
- [ ] Pixels jointly distributed as per Gaussian distribution in the Latent Space. 
- [ ] Train a NN to convert the LV from this space into an image 
- [ ] How is this even possible?
- [ ] The noise is actually a latent vector. By using the Langevin Process to add noise, we are constraining the Latent Space to obey the Gaussian Distribution.
- [ ] During training we are mapping LVs back to images
- [ ] Create new images by interpolating in the latent space
- [ ] Text to image conversion: Map text to a latent variable using a LLM, and then map the LV to an image.
