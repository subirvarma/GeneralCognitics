# Latent Spaces: Capturing Structure in Complex Systems

## Introduction

A few years ago, the later Freeman Dyson wrote an interesting essay titled ["Why is Maxwell's theory so difficult to understand?"](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/em/dyson.pdf), in which he made the interesting observation that the Electro-Magnetic theory presents a picture of the world that has two layers. The first layer, which consists of the Electric and Magnetic fields that make up the theory, is entirely described using mathematical equations that govern these fields, how they interact with each other and how they evolve over time. The quantitities in this layer, namely the aformentioned fields, are abstract in nature and not accessible to our senses. The second layer on the other hand, consists of quantities such as energy and forces that we can directly measure, and are a part of our world. These second layer quantities can be computed from the abstract first layer quantities. This two layer structure is useful since it turns out that a mathematical description of the second layer by itself is intractable. On the other hand, the first layer lends itself to a mathematical description (the Maxwell's Equations of Electro-Magnetic Theory), which though complex, is still tractable. Dyson further observed that Quantum Mechanics, whose equations were discovered about 60 years after Maxwell's Equations, also shares this two layer structure. In this case the first layer consists of quantities such as the Schrodinger Wave Function or Quantum Fields that are once again inaccessible to our senses, but nevertheless lend themselves to a mathematical description. The second layer consists of predictions about atomic processes which can be computed using the equations of Quantum Mechanics and verified using experiments. 
For both Electro-Magnetics and Quantum Mechanics, the fundamental physical processes happen in their respective first layers and are hidden from us. Scientists have tried to create a understandable model of the first layer in terms of processes and objects that are familiar to us. For example Electro-Magnetic Fields were initially modeled using a mechanical model consisting of springs while attempts have been made to model Quantum Mechanics using familiar objects such as particles and waves. However, in both cases the attempts have been unsuccessful. Dyson makes the point that the first layer is an entirely mathematical construction, and it doesn't make sense to try to reduce it to descriptions that make sense in the macro world that we live in. The main utility of this layer is to provide a mathematically tractable model from which predictions about events in the real world can be made with a high degree of accuracy. The process by which the real world in layer twomanifests itself from layer one, remains laregly mysterious, and goes by names such as  Quantum Wave Collpase or Quantum Decoherence. 

My objective in this essay to explore the existence of the two layer structure as a common organizing principle that is used for organizing other complex systems as well. In Biology, the genetic code can be considered to the first layer structure, which by itself is fairly simple to describe, but when expressed in the language of proteins and cells, results in the complex second layer structure and multiplicity of living things that we find around us. In the main part of the essay I will argue that modern Deep Learning systems also obey the two layer design principle. In this case first layer typically goes by the name of Latent Variables. These are not comprehensible to our senses, but they capture the structure present in objects in the real world, such as images and languages, that form the second layer of the structure. The Neural Network serves as a system to convert the abstract first layer latent variables into inconcrete objects such as images and language.
