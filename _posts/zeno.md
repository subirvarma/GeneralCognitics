# Zeno's Paradox: Then and Now

 [online book on this subject](https://srdas.github.io/DLBook2/)


- Zeno’s paradox of the arrow 1) paradox of velocity 2) paradox of movement 
- Why it’s a paradox, if the arrow is not moving at any point in time, how does it get from point A to point B?
- Differential calculus view of the paradox 
- Integral calculus view
- Kant’s view of the paradox 
- Quantum Mechanics and the paradox, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
- The quantum field representation for a particle 
- We have replaced one paradox by another: how can an object be in motion and not in motion at the same time to, how can an object exhibit both particle and wave like properties?


## Introduction





## Zeno's Paradox of the Arrow


## Its Really a Question about the Nature of Infinity



## How Calculus Resolved the Paradox (or did it?)


### Differential Calculus or How to Divide an Infinitely Small Quanity by Another



### Integral Calculus or How to Add Up Infinitely Many Infinitely Small Quanitities


## Quantum Mechanics and the Paradox

### The Uncertainity Principle




### Quantum Field Equations for a Particle




## So Where Does That Leave us? Kant's take on the Paradox

### Do Infinitely Small Quanitities Actually Exist?

### Do Time and Space Actually Exist?
