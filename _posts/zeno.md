# Zeno's Paradox of the Arrow

 [online book on this subject](https://srdas.github.io/DLBook2/)


- Zeno’s paradox of the arrow 1) paradox of velocity 2) paradox of movement 
- Why it’s a paradox, if the arrow is not moving at any point in time, how does it get from point A to point B?
- Differential calculus view of the paradox 
- Integral calculus view
- Kant’s view of the paradox 
- Quantum Mechanics and the paradox, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
- The quantum field representation for a particle 
- We have replaced one paradox by another: how can an object be in motion and not in motion at the same time to, how can an object exhibit both particle and wave like properties?


## Introduction

Zeno of Elea was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived around 500 BC. He was a disciple of the philosopher Parmenides, who beleived that all of reality consisted of an undifferentaited, unchanginf motionaless whole, which did not consist of any parts. Hence  aspects such as motion, change and pluraity were illusions according to him. In support of this point of view, Zeno came up with several paradoxes, which have continued to puzzle philosophers and scientists, even to the present day. Fundamentally, these paradoxes drill through to the very nature of fundamental aspects of reality such as the nature of time, space and motion, as well as the nature of infinity, so that their resolution requires a deep understanding of mathematics as well as physics. This level of understanding didn't begin to develop until the 17th century, with the development of infintesmal calculus as well the revolution in Physics that was bought about by Newton and his contemprories. However a more complete resolution had to await the 19th century, in which mathematicians such as Cauchy, Weierstrass, Dedekin and Cantor laid thesubject of calculus and the nature of infinity on a firmer mathematical footing and it seemed that the paradoxes had finally met their resolution. This state of affairs was shaken in the 20th century with the discovery of Quantum Mechanics, which upended our understanding of how microscopic particles  behave. This led to a re-evaluation of the paradoxes in the light of the Uncertainity Principle and the fact that matter seems to have both wave and particle properties. 

In this essay we will focus on one of Zeno's paradoxes, called the Paradox of the Arrow, and we wil trace how our understanding of this paradox has changed since the time of Zeno, and continues to evolve even today. 




## Zeno's Paradox of the Arrow


## Its Really a Question about the Nature of Infinity



## How Calculus Resolved the Paradox (or did it?)


### Differential Calculus or How to Divide an Infinitely Small Quanity by Another



### Integral Calculus or How to Add Up Infinitely Many Infinitely Small Quanitities


## Quantum Mechanics and the Paradox

### The Uncertainity Principle




### Quantum Field Equations for a Particle




## So Where Does That Leave us? Kant's take on the Paradox

### Do Infinitely Small Quanitities Actually Exist?

### Do Time and Space Actually Exist?
