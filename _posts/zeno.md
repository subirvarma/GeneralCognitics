---

 [online book on this subject](https://srdas.github.io/DLBook2/)


- Zeno’s paradox of the arrow 1) paradox of velocity 2) paradox of movement 
- Why it’s a paradox, if the arrow is not moving at any point in time, how does it get from point A to point B?
- Differential calculus view of the paradox 
- Integral calculus view
- Kant’s view of the paradox 
- Quantum Mechanics and the paradox, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
- The quantum field representation for a particle 
- We have replaced one paradox by another: how can an object be in motion and not in motion at the same time to, how can an object exhibit both particle and wave like properties?
