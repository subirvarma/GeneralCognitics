# Systems of Interacting Particles

Book Review: Critical Mass, How One Thing Leads to Another by Philip Ball

Summary:
- Start by talking about city segregation statistics in the US. Racism has gone down in the US since the 1960s, especially in metropolitan areas. The what accounts for the segregation that we see in cities?
- Talk about stock market fluctuations. Can these be caused by trading patterns rather than market fundamentals?
- Is there a science that connects macroscopic behavior to microscopis rules of interacton between individual entities?
- Beginnings of such a science: Maxwell's kinetic theory of gasses. Assumes that particles move independently, leads to Gaussian distribution. This did not explain phase transitions.
- Van der Waals theory of phase transitions. He introduced rules for interaction between particles.
- Other systems that also exhibit phase transitions: Magnetic materials, the Ising model, crowd motion,
- Traffic models, the concept of metastability
- Ch 8 on stock market models can be omitted, it does not really talk about individual interactions
- How trading patterns can cause market volatility
- The Power Law and Self Organized Criticality (SoC), non-equilibrieum models. Natural Systems that obey this law: Eartquakes, forest fires, volcanic activity
- Power Law in human systems (Zipf)
- Model for Firms, power laws for sizes of firms, how individual behavior can be used to explain rise and fall of firms
- Models for alliances, corporate and political, Axelrod model
- Schelling model, p389. How macrobehavior cannot be predicted from individual behavior, racial segregation
- Hysterisis effects in crime stats, Ormerod and Campbell model
- Models for human culture, formation of stable cultural differences
- Sugarscape: Models for society, emergence of in-equality
- Graph models, small world models, models for the web,

## Introduction

A couple of moinths ago when I was doing research for my post on Brownian Motion, I saw a reference to the book "Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another" by the science writer Phillip Ball. I finally got around to reading the book, and this post is the result. The book is over 650 pages and has a lot of material on the topic of Interacting Particle Systems. In this post I will attempt to summarize the parts that I found the most interesting, but I would encourage you to read the entire book, it is a fascinating topic.

So what are Interacting Particle Systems (or IPS)? As the name implies, these are systems consisting of multitudes of particles which influence each others movement in some fashion. These systems can serve as abstract representations of several real world systems that are of practical interest, such as:

- All of matter can be considered to be an IPS, which individual particles being atoms or molecules. Phenomena such as phase transitions from liquid to a gas, or from a non-magnetic material to magnetic, fall within the range of topics that have been analysed using intarcting partcle models.
- The motion of crowds of people is an example of IPS. The theory can be used to predict what happens in a crowded room when everyone tries to exist at once, a painfully common occurrence which ahs led to loss of life.
- Moving vehicles on the road are another example of IPS. Phenomena such gridlock in rush hour traffic have been studied using the theory.

A very interesting application of the theory has been to models for structures that exist in our society. These include:

- 






## The First Models: Kinetic Theory of Gases




## Models Exhibiting Phase Transitions

- Gas/liquids, magnetic materials, crowd motion, Traffic Models



## Non-Equilibrium Models: Self Organized Criticality (SOC)




## Emergence of Power Laws in Interacting Particle Systems


### Why do the Power Laws Arise?

- Scale Free Interactions
- Due to purposive behavior on part of individual agents, p 331

### Examples: Company Sizes, Stock Market, 


### Small World Models: Social Networks


## Application to Human Affairs


### Model for Segregation in Cities


### Models of Alliances in Companies and Countries


### Human Culture (Axelrod Model)


### Sugarscape

## Neural Networks as Interacting Particle Systems

- Start with random connection strengths, gradually change them to optimize a global loss function
- Skip connections and Attention as ways to reduce the average connection length L
- Analogy with Spin Glasses
- Hopfield Networks
- Re-Normalization Applied to Neural Networks

  
## Space Time as Interacting Particle Systems

- Discrete models for Space-Time
