# Systems of Interacting Particles

Book Review: Critical Mass, How One Thing Leads to Another by Philip Ball

Summary:
- Start by talking about city segregation statistics in the US. Racism has gone down in the US since the 1960s, especially in metropolitan areas. The what accounts for the segregation that we see in cities?
- Talk about stock market fluctuations. Can these be caused by trading patterns rather than market fundamentals?
- Is there a science that connects macroscopic behavior to microscopis rules of interacton between individual entities?
- Beginnings of such a science: Maxwell's kinetic theory of gasses. Assumes that particles move independently, leads to Gaussian distribution. This did not explain phase transitions.
- Van der Waals theory of phase transitions. He introduced rules for interaction between particles.
- Other systems that also exhibit phase transitions: Magnetic materials, the Ising model, crowd motion,
- Traffic models, the concept of metastability
- Ch 8 on stock market models can be omitted, it does not really talk about individual interactions
- How trading patterns can cause market volatility
- The Power Law and Self Organized Criticality (SoC), non-equilibrieum models. Natural Systems that obey this law: Eartquakes, forest fires, volcanic activity
- Power Law in human systems (Zipf)
- Model for Firms, power laws for sizes of firms, how individual behavior can be used to explain rise and fall of firms
- Models for alliances, corporate and political, Axelrod model
- Schelling model, p389. How macrobehavior cannot be predicted from individual behavior, racial segregation
- Hysterisis effects in crime stats, Ormerod and Campbell model
- Models for human culture, formation of stable cultural differences
- Sugarscape: Models for society, emergence of in-equality
- Graph models, small world models, models for the web,

## Introduction



## The First Models: Kinetic Theory of Gases




## Models Exhibiting Phase Transitions

- Gas/liquids, magnetic materials, crowd motion, Traffic Models



## Non-Equilibrium Models: Self Organized Criticality (SOC)




## The Power Law


### Why do the Power Laws Arise?

- Scale Free Interactions
- Due to purposive behavior on part of individual agents, p 331

### Examples: Company Sizes, Stock Market, 


### Small World Models: Social Networks


## Application to Human Affairs


### Model for Segregation in Cities


### Models of Alliances in Companies and Countries


### Human Culture (Axelrod Model)


### Sugarscape

## Neural Networks as Interacting Particle Systems

- Start with random connection strengths, gradually change them to optimize a global loss function
- Skip connections and Attention as ways to reduce the average connection length L
- Analogy with Spin Glasses
- Hopfield Networks
- Re-Normalization Applied to Neural Networks
- Models of Space Time
